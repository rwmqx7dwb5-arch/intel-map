//  IntMap · ai-proxy  —  Supabase Edge Function (Deno)
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Account-based, first-party AI. Replaces the old BYOK (bring-your-own-key)
//  client flow. Every AI feature in index.html (askAI -> aiCallServer) POSTs
//  here with the user's Supabase session JWT. This function:
//
//    1. Verifies the JWT and resolves the user  (login REQUIRED → 401 if not).
//    2. Looks up the user's plan + daily quota   (free = 10/day; easily tiered).
//       ⚠ THE NUMBER IS PLAN_LIMITS BELOW, NOT THIS LINE. It read «30/day» for the whole of the
//       time #R147 had already moved free to 10 — a header that restates a constant twenty lines
//       above it is a second copy, and the copy is the one a reader meets first.
//    3. Atomically consumes one use for today    (increment_ai_usage RPC).
//       → over quota returns 429 {error:"limit", used, limit}.
//    4. Calls the provider with a SERVER-HELD key (model fixed here — the user
//       never sees a key or a model picker).
//    5. Returns { text, used, limit, remaining, charged, meta }. On a provider failure the
//       consumed slot is refunded so a failed call never costs the user a use.
//

//  (#R113) Gemini 3.5 Flash / thinkingLevel:"low" migration — RESPONSIBILITY SPLIT.
//  The old lightweight model hid design gaps by hallucinating; Gemini Low stops
//  instead of inventing, so the gaps surfaced as MALFORMED_FUNCTION_CALL / empty
//  responses. This function now:
//    • Reads a TASK type from the client (atlas_plan | map_report | research_map |
//      analysis | free_text | json_extract | brief | geo_verify | geo_resolve) and
//      configures per-task output budget, JSON mode and web policy — instead of one
//      MAX_TOKENS / one web flag for all. (#R135) research_map = time-axis research /
//      situation map (historical/current/mixed): a written explanation + related
//      mappable places; JSON task, client passes its own schema, webMode from the
//      Request Profile (historical → optional web on the TOPIC, never current-news).
//    • Uses Gemini Structured Output (responseMimeType:"application/json" + an
//      optional responseSchema) for the JSON tasks, so JSON no longer depends on
//      the prompt alone (kills fences / prose / most MALFORMED_FUNCTION_CALLs).
//    • NEVER attaches a tool the prompt didn't earn: Google Search grounding is
//      attached ONLY when webMode !== "off" AND GEMINI_SEARCH_ENABLED === "true".
//      Default OFF → map_report runs purely on client-gathered evidence.
//    • Classifies provider failures (rate_limit / quota / malformed / empty /
//      blocked / unavailable / invalid_structured_output) and returns 502/503 —
//      NEVER 429 (429 is reserved for the IntMap daily free-use limit).
//    • Retries a MALFORMED_FUNCTION_CALL exactly once with tools stripped +
//      "do not call functions" hardened + JSON mode forced.
//  Secrets, JWTs and full prompts are never logged.
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  (#R114) OpenAI GPT-5.6 migration (from Gemini) — Responses API path.
//  (#R148) Model is GPT-5.6 Luna. R147 switched it to Terra, but this OpenAI project has NO access
//  to Terra (403 model_not_found) → Atlas went fully down; reverted to Luna (accessible, verified)
//  and added a model-not-found FALLBACK_MODEL retry. Set via the AI_MODEL secret; the Gemini path
//  stays wired but dormant — Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite is never used.
//    • OpenAI calls go through /v1/responses (reasoning.effort:"low", store:false),
//      text + image input, JSON mode for the JSON tasks (map_report / json_extract).
//    • Web search is a HOSTED tool attached only when the client asks (webMode
//      auto|required). webMode:"required" (e.g. a "latest" brief) FORCES a tool call
//      so the search can't be silently skipped; a 400 on that forcing degrades to
//      model-choice. We COUNT the web_search_call items actually emitted and return
//      meta.webUsed / meta.webSearches so the client can keep "latest" claims honest.
//    • insufficient_quota / billing-hard-limit → provider_quota (hard 502), never a
//      transient retry. Gemini + Anthropic paths are unchanged and still selectable.
//  (#R115) Luna quality tuning: on OpenAI, atlas_plan also runs in JSON mode (the
//  R113c exclusion was Gemini-latency-only — malformed planner JSON was a major
//  "could not interpret" source); an EMPTY/incomplete response (reasoning ate the
//  budget) is retried once with a bigger budget; atlas_plan budget 1800→2200.
//  (#R116) Outage-proofing + quality: the OpenAI call DEGRADES instead of failing —
//  400s walk a fallback ladder (drop tool_choice → drop JSON mode → drop tools) and a
//  timed-out web-search call retries once tool-free (webUsed stays honest), so a
//  request-shape rejection can never blanket-kill Atlas AI again. Per-task reasoning
//  effort: atlas_plan + analysis think at "medium" (complex/ambiguous requests were
//  failing at "low"), extraction tasks stay "low". Web calls get a 90s leash.

   `system` used to share MAX_PROMPT with `prompt`. But `system` is not user text — it is the Atlas
   prompt the app itself builds, and the planner's is the action CATALOGUE: every button, layer,
   panel and setting described to the model. Measured on the deployed build (v46): that string is
   ~91 kB, so `.slice(0, 24_000)` threw away roughly two thirds of it, mid-word, inside the `engine`
   action's description. Everything documented after that point — several dozen actions, the layer
   list, the module list, the control list — DID NOT EXIST for the planner.
   ⚠ AND THE GATE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO CATCH THIS COULD NOT SEE IT. scripts/atlas-catalog.mjs
   (#R278) checks that every dispatch capability is described in function SYS() — it reads the
   SOURCE, and the source was complete. What was incomplete was the part that arrived. A catalogue
   gate that stops at the client is measuring the letter, not the delivery.
   The cap stays a cap: `prompt` — the half that carries user text — keeps 24 kB, and `system` gets
   a bound of its own, set well above the real maximum rather than below it. */

   MAX_PROMPT and MAX_IMAGES were applied AFTER `await req.json()`, i.e. after the whole body had
   already been read into the isolate and parsed. `{"images":[<400 MB of base64>]}` was therefore
   accepted, buffered and parsed in full before the code that limits it to four ever ran — and the
   caller only needs to be logged in, because the quota is consumed a step earlier. Every bound below
   is measured against what the CLIENT actually sends, so none of them can be reached by normal use:
     · js/atlas-console.js compresses each picked image with compressImage(f, 2000, 0.9) — a 2000 px
       JPEG at q=0.9, i.e. ~0.5-2 MB, base64'd to ~0.7-2.7 MB — and slices the list to 4.
     · the prompt string is already clamped to MAX_PROMPT (24 kB) and, since #R285, the system string
       to MAX_SYSTEM (160 kB) — together still four orders of magnitude under the body ceiling below.
   (#R540) Attachments changed that arithmetic: a request may now also carry up to MAX_DOCS_BYTES of
   PDF and MAX_FILES_TEXT of extracted text, and base64 costs a third on top. The ceiling is 32 MB —
   the figure Anthropic itself puts on ONE Messages request, deliberately not a byte above it. It is
   a real bound rather than a notional one: filling the raster channel (12 MB decoded → ~16 MB
   base64) AND the document channel (12 MB → ~16 MB) in the same request does not fit, and such a
   request is refused before it is read rather than after it is parsed. */

/* ══ ⚠⚠⚠ (#R540) AN ATTACHMENT IS ITS OWN CHANNEL, AND IT GETS ITS OWN BOUND ══════════════════════
   The only attachment that ever reached this function was an image. A text file was pasted by the
   client INTO `prompt` as an «[ATTACHED FILE …]» section — and `prompt` is sliced to MAX_PROMPT
   (24 kB), while the client will read 60 kB from each of four files. So most of what the reader
   attached was cut, mid-word, with nothing said about it to the reader OR to the model, which then
   answered about the part that survived as though it were the whole. That is exactly the shape
   #R285 found in `system`, and it has the same fix: the field that carries the user's TYPED text
   keeps its 24 kB, and every other channel is given a bound of ITS OWN.
     · files — text THIS app extracted (txt/csv/md/json/docx/xlsx/…); the provider sees it as text.
     · docs  — bytes the PROVIDER parses. PDF is what all three read as a document (Anthropic
       `document`, OpenAI `input_file`, Gemini `inline_data`), in the same sense that png/jpeg/webp/
       gif is what all three read as a raster. DOC_MIME states that upstream fact; it is not a list
       of cases, and a format is added to it only when all three providers accept it.
   OBSERVED (2026-09-07, provider documentation): Anthropic's Messages API caps one REQUEST at 32 MB
   and one PDF at 600 pages (100 on the 200k-context models). 8 MB sits well inside a single PDF's
   share of that, and four documents plus four images stay inside MAX_BODY_BYTES above.
   EXPIRES WHEN: a provider moves its request ceiling, or a second document format becomes readable
   by all three — then these numbers and DOC_MIME are re-measured, not extended case by case.
   CANONICAL: here. The client holds the same numbers in js/atlas-attach.js `ATL_FILE.LIMITS`
   (images/files/docs, textPerFile/textTotal, docBytes/docsBytes) and tests/r540 asserts the two are
   EQUAL rather than re-stating either — a client that trims to a wider bound than the server

/* ══ (#R397) THE SCHEMA REACHED GEMINI AND NEVER REACHED OPENAI ═══════════════════════════════════
   `responseSchema` is resolved above for every JSON task — MAP_REPORT_SCHEMA, ANSWER_SCHEMA, and
   whatever js/ passes (PLAN_SCHEMA, RESEARCH_MAP_SCHEMA, GEO_RESOLVE_SCHEMA) — and then handed to
   `callGemini` at four call sites. `callOpenAI` never had the parameter. On the provider this app
   actually runs (AI_PROVIDER=openai) the model was therefore asked for `{type:"json_object"}` and
   nothing else: a bare "must be JSON", with the field names, the enumerations and the required set
   living only in the prose of the task rules and in the client's post-hoc normaliser.

   That is the shape behind a whole family of reported Atlas failures — a plan that names a field
   the executor does not read, an answer whose `claims[].dimension` is absent so the audit cannot
   compare, a `places` array of bare strings. None of them are model stubbornness; the schema was
   never in the request.

   ⚠ IT IS A LADDER RUNG, NOT A SWITCH. OpenAI's `json_schema` format is stricter than the Gemini
   dialect these schemas are written in, so a rejection must degrade to exactly today's behaviour
   rather than fail the call — see the 400 ladder in callOpenAI(). `strictJsonSchema` is what makes
   the two dialects meet:
     · type names are upper-case in the Gemini REST dialect (`"OBJECT"`) and lower-case in JSON
       Schema (`"object"`);
     · `strict:true` requires EVERY property in `required` and `additionalProperties:false`. Forcing
       a field the schema left optional would change the contract, so an optional field is widened
       to `["string","null"]` instead — the documented way to say "required key, may be absent in
       meaning". Every consumer already coerces: normalizeAnswer() runs `String(v == null ? '' : v)`
       and `Array.isArray(v) ? v : []` over the whole object, so a null lands as '' or [] exactly as
       an omitted key does today.
     · Gemini-only keywords (`nullable`, `propertyOrdering`) and `format` are dropped: they are the
       dialect, not the contract. */
