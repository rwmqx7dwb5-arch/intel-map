 *  IntMap · #R282 source checks
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  「最近あなたがたくさん作業しても、One driveがあまり変わってなさそうなのはなぜですか？」
 *  「いやそもそもOneDriveが原本やろが。なんでOneDriveを編集しとらんねん。」
 *
 *  The master copy sat fifteen commits behind origin/main because no step in the workflow owned
 *  it. #R282 gave it an owner: scripts/master-sync.mjs plus the three places in AGENTS.md that
 *  name it. This file is the measurement of that rule (#R278: a rule written in prose gets a check
 *  that measures it, in the same round) — and of the one property that makes the tool correct at
 *  all, namely that it FINDS the master rather than being told where it is.
 *
 *  ⚠ §③ AND §④ BUILD A REAL REPOSITORY AND RUN THE REAL SCRIPT AGAINST IT. A gate that only ever
 *  saw a healthy tree would be green because it looked at nothing (#R274 ③); here the synthetic
 *  master is deliberately put one commit behind, the check is required to go RED and to say so,
 *  and only then is it fast-forwarded and required to go green.
 *  ⚠ COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED BEFORE ANY SEARCH OF THE SCRIPT. The script's own banner quotes paths
 *  and directory names that §① forbids in executable code (「自分の検査が自分のコメントに当たる」,
 *  fifteen times now).
 *  ⚠ package.json IS READ AS JSON, NOT AS TEXT — the `//master` note beside the commands says the
 *  words §⑥ looks for, and a raw-text search would find the note instead of the command.
 *  ⚠ CONTENT ASSERTIONS NORMALISE LINE ENDINGS. core.autocrlf=true is the local setting, so a
 *  checkout hands back CRLF; the claim being made here is about the bytes of the CONTENT, and
 *  writing it any other way makes the file fail on Windows for a reason that is not the subject.
