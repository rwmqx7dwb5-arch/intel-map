 *  #R273 — source-level checks
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  What this round was asked for, and what each test holds:
 *
 *    ① 「GDACSを完全に撤廃しろ」「ソースは一国一ソース」「対応国も増やせ」
 *    ② 「日本では気象庁の塗分けに対応させろ。また、市町村単位で塗り分けろ」
 *    ③ 「まだ対応していない国は灰色斜線で、発令されていないだけの地域は灰色に」
 *    ④ 「各国の警報階級を同じ紫・赤・黄に押し込んでいる」→ 各国公式配色 / IntMap換算の切替
 *    ⑤ 「何の警報なのか地図から分からない」→ 種別を区域に文字で、重複は +N
 *    ⑥ 「更新時間31.1hと2minが同列」→ Fresh / Delayed / Stale / Error
 *    ⑦ 「一覧が取得先一覧になっている」→ パネルは「どこで何が」から始まる
 *    ⑧ 「これ長すぎ」→ 出典の一文
 *    ⑨ 「なにか形がおかしい×をやめろ」→ アプリ全体で1つの ×
 *    ⑩ 「セルビア語系言語は似た色味に」
 *    ⑪ 「水流シミュレーションの解像度が低すぎる」「一回きりの水源、再生できない」
 *    ⑫ 「大規模にレイヤーカテゴリ分類を再編しろ」→ 見出しの名前が中身と一致する
 *
 *  ⚠ EVERY «X is gone» ASSERTION IS WRITTEN IN THE SYNTAX X WAS WRITTEN IN, and against the source
 *  with its comments stripped — the prose that RECORDS a removal is not evidence against it. That
 *  is #R266's own lesson, and it has cost this repo a round twice.
