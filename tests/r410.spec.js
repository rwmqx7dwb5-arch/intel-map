 *  R410 — 時間を戻したとき、国境だけでなく「国名」も戻る
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  「歴史地図の国名ラベルが、同じ画面の Countries 一覧と食い違う。」 #R409 の実測。
 *  1939 → 1916 と戻すと、地図は 1916 年に «Nazi Germany»・«Spanish Republic»・
 *  «United Kingdom» のままだった——1939 年の名前と、1916 年には存在しない国名である。
 *
 *  ⚠⚠⚠ **この検査は「描かれた文字」を読む。プロパティを読むのではない。**
 *  `imtb-lbl` / `imtb-lbl2` の地物プロパティ `NAME` は**どちらの場合も «Germany»** で
 *  正しいので、ソースのプロパティを読む検査は**画面が間違っているあいだ緑になる**
 *  （#R409 の報告がそう名指ししている）。ここで読むのは
 *    ① どちらのレイヤーが**実際にその地物を描いたか**（`queryRenderedFeatures` は
 *       レイヤーの filter を適用するので、`_same` の振り分けがそのまま試験される）
 *    ② そのレイヤーが**今まさに宣言している** `text-field` 式を、その地物に当てた結果
 *  で、式は `getLayoutProperty` から取る——ここに `['coalesce',['get','_locName'],…]` を
 *  書き写すと、レイヤー側を変えたときに**検査だけが古い主張を続ける**ことになる。
 *
 *  ⚠⚠ **地図の主張と一覧の主張を、同じ瞬間に両方読む。** 「1916 年の正しい名前」を
 *  地図についてだけ確かめる検査は、一覧が別の名前を出していても緑になる——報告された
 *  欠陥は「どちらかが間違っている」ではなく「**二つが食い違っている**」である。
 *
 *  ⚠ 起動時に一覧の元データ（Natural Earth の属性）が遅れて届く側の半分は
 *  `tests/r410-late.spec.js`（deep tier）にある。あちらは自分の page を起動して
 *  route で遅らせるので、この門の半分は共有 page のまま数秒で済む。
 *
 *  ⚠ (#R423) THE COUNTRIES LIST IS ALSO SWEPT WHOLE HERE, at the end of ①, once the clock is back
 *  at Now: every code `countryGeo` holds that Natural Earth itself types as a country must have a
 *  rendered row. 「Norway has no row in the Countries list, at ANY year including the present.」
 *  It rides on this file because the stage — a booted app with the Countries tab open — is already
 *  paid for; measured, it costs 0.6 s (9.05 s against 9.65 s for ① alone), and the suite ceiling has
 *  no headroom left. The hermetic and exhaustive half of that claim, including WHY the Natural Earth
 *  record was wrong, is tests/r423-checks.test.mjs.
