/* ============================================================================
 *  IntMap · #R397 — Atlas's own eyes were shut, and its own data was a ceiling
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  「AtlasがIntMapを使うのであり、AtlasがIntMapに従属するのではありません。」
 *
 *  ⚠⚠⚠ THE CENTRAL FINDING OF THIS ROUND IS THAT THE VERIFIER COULD NOT SEE. Three names in
 *  js/atlas-capabilities.js — the file whose whole job is to observe the app before and after every
 *  operation — did not exist, and `try{}catch(_){}` turned each one into a plausible reading:
 *
 *    · `GE().layers.list()`   — no such method on the façade. `visibleLayerIds()` returned [] forever.
 *    · `getCenter()` read as `c[0]`/`c[1]` — it returns `{lng,lat}`, so lng/lat were NaN, and
 *      `JSON.stringify(NaN)` is `null`, so the camera observer compared nulls and COULD ONLY SEE
 *      ZOOM. A `view.flyTo` across the planet at an unchanged zoom reported `no_change`.
 *    · `'nlq-pin-src'` / `'atl-poi-src'` — source ids that occurred on exactly one line in the whole
 *      repository, this file's. The paint observer could not see a pin appear.
 *
 *  Every assertion about those three is derived FROM THE FAÇADE'S OWN SOURCE, not from a name typed
 *  here — because a name typed here is the same mistake in a second place (#R323's lesson: two lists
 *  that describe one thing and are never compared). So §1 reads js/geo-engine.js to learn which
 *  methods exist, and §2 reads js/app-body.js and js/atlas-console.js to learn which source ids do.
 *
 *  ⚠ AND EVERY NEGATIVE CHECK HERE WAS MUTATED UNTIL IT WENT RED. #R392's lesson — 「検査は変異させて
 *  赤を見るまで書けていない」 — cost that round two green tests that proved nothing. The mutation for
 *  each block is named in its comment, and §7 re-runs three of the pure predicates against
 *  deliberately wrong inputs so the file demonstrates its own sensitivity rather than asserting it.
 *
 *  ⚠ §5 (the intent gates) and §6 (the goal gate) are gone: #R406 deleted js/atlas-planner.js, so
 *  no regular expression reads the request and there is no plan for a gate to sit in front of. §7's
 *  two surviving claims — IntMap's data is not a ceiling, and a centroid is not a place — are
 *  asserted against the rewritten core paragraph in js/atlas-policy.js.
