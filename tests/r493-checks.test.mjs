/* ============================================================================
 *  IntMap · R493 — ATLAS CAN LOOK AT THE MAP  (view.inspect)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  「Atlas自身が地図画像を添付できるようにする」
 *
 *  Atlas has read IntMap's inside since #R318 and had never seen its outside. This round gives it
 *  one capability whose result is a PICTURE — and the three things that can quietly make such a
 *  feature a no-op are what is checked here:
 *
 *   ① two captures. The screenshot button's picture and Atlas's picture must be the same code, or
 *      「読者が見ているもの」 becomes two different claims (#R231 measured what that costs INSIDE
 *      one file, when the map layer was sized from the backing store and the overlays from the CSS box).
 *   ② the image in the wrong channel. js/atlas-agent.js hands tool results back as JSON inside the
 *      PROMPT TEXT; a data URL put there is not an image, it is half a megabyte of base64. The
 *      pixels have to leave through the vision argument and the record has to stay small.
 *   ③ a capability that exists everywhere except in the switch. Registry, schema, catalogue, tool
 *      surface and dispatch are five files, and four of five is a tool that always fails.
 *
 *  ④ is not about this feature at all. Building it surfaced that the mechanical `exec` block a
 *  dispatch case returns has NEVER reached Atlas: js/atlas-results.js reads it out of
 *  `observed.exec`, and the only writer of that key is `fromLegacy`, which the app does not call.
 *  #R413 fixed `view.locate` to return one and its check pinned the SPELLING of the line — so the
 *  block was written, asserted, and dropped. The test below drives the REAL executor.
