   This file used to say 「and it knows all eight」 with the eight globals written out beside it. By
   the time anybody ran it the loader knew TEN — #R224 moved the Atlas kernel behind it, #R291 the
   directions panel — and the spec had been failing on the nightly for a fortnight for saying `8`.
   A count is a copy of a fact; the fact is in js/lazy-modules.js, so read it from there. Adding an
   eleventh module now changes what this file demands, in the same commit, without anybody editing
   it — and a module that is registered but publishes nothing still fails, which is the point. */

     If a deferred global were present with nothing pending, its file would be in the boot bundle

     ⚠ (#R304) IT CANNOT BE «typeof === undefined» FULL STOP, AND FINDING OUT WHY IS WHAT THIS ROUND
     BOUGHT. The old version wrote out eight globals by hand and `atlasConsole` was not among them —
     so #R224's rule that a DESKTOP warms the Atlas kernel 1.2 s after the map goes idle (never on a
     phone, never on Save-Data, never before first paint) has had no browser guard at all since the
     round that introduced it. Measured on a fresh page here: `IntMapConsole` is `undefined` at the
     boot barrier and an object about four seconds later, with `atlasConsole` in `pending()`.
     Asserting «undefined» would therefore be asserting a race, and asserting nothing is how the rule
     got no guard in the first place. So the claim is the honest one: a deferred module is present
     ONLY IF somebody went through the loader for it — which is exactly what «not in the boot
     bundle» means — and then, separately, that the only thing warmed without a gesture is the one
     module #R224 says may be. */
