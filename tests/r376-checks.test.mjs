 *  IntMap · #R376 source checks — the four things production verification found
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  #R356 shipped the multi-model weather platform and every gate was green: 2,236 node checks,
 *  48 browser assertions, CI, CodeQL. Production verification then found FOUR defects, and every
 *  one of them was invisible to a check that reads this repository against itself.
 *
 *    ① Atlas reported a SUCCESSFUL model switch as a failure. `data.wxModel` was declared with the
 *       `paint` observer, which counts drawn FEATURES; a raster source swap draws exactly as many
 *       as it drew before. MEASURED on production, three models, three times:
 *       `status:"partial" code:"not_rendered" ok:false` while the legend, the picker, `modelOf()`
 *       and the style's source url had all become DWD ICON.
 *    ② Two switches in a row made the first one report `not_painted_yet`. The waiter queue woke
 *       EVERY waiter on the next commit, so the in-flight switch was resolved with somebody else's
 *       provenance.
 *    ③ The cursor readout kept sampling `window.IntMapECMWF` — the DEFAULT model. A layer switched
 *       to ICON drew ICON tiles while the readout printed ECMWF's number and ECMWF's valid time.
 *       ⚠ Nothing looked broken: a plausible temperature is not a visibly wrong one.
 *    ④ Every offered model was instantiated at boot, because the legend picker asked each of them
 *       「can you draw this layer?」 through `model()`, which BUILDS. No network followed, so the
 *       cost was objects — but js/wx-ecmwf.js's own comment claimed a session that never switches
 *       builds exactly one, and that had stopped being true.
 *
 *  ⚠ THE COMMON SHAPE: each defect is a disagreement between two things this repository holds, and
 *  in all four cases BOTH halves were self-consistent. That is why the checks below assert the
 *  RELATION between the halves rather than the content of either.
