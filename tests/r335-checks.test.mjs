 *  #R335 — the character converter does not convert vocabulary, ONE ROUND LATER
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  #R319 found 紐西蘭 and 玻里尼西亞 shipping to Simplified readers as 纽西兰 / 玻里尼西亚: words
 *  whose characters are ALREADY shared between the two orthographies, so OpenCC `tw→cn` converts
 *  them to themselves and every orthography check in the project reads them as perfectly correct.
 *  「社群」 was the next one — the Taiwanese word for a community, shipped in the airplanes.live
 *  source description and in the Community tab, where the mainland word is 「社區」.
 *
 *  ⚠ THE POINT OF THIS FILE IS NOT THE ONE WORD. A hand-kept vocabulary table has no way to say
 *  what it is MISSING (the same shape as #R251's character map and [[intmap-recurring-lessons]] G),
 *  so this round stopped reading and asked a published table: OpenCC's SECOND Taiwan profile,
 *  twp→cn, converts vocabulary as well as orthography. Run OUTSIDE the pipeline — where #R251
 *  correctly refuses to run it, because inside it double-converts this project's own output — it is
 *  not a converter but an INVENTORY. 96 distinct disagreements over 8,321 Han runs; 49 survived
 *  being read one at a time, and they are the rows tagged (#R335) in scripts/zh-hans.mjs.
