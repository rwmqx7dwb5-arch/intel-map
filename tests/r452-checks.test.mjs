/* ============================================================================
 *  R452 — A TURN THAT ALWAYS ENDS
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Reported from production (build R430 / R433, measured 2026-08-24): open a News event's detail
 *  through `.ev-sources`, ask Atlas 「この出来事について詳しく」, and the bubble stays on 「Searching」
 *  for more than two minutes before the renderer itself stops responding — taking other tabs on the
 *  same origin with it. `ai-proxy` answered 200 both times (5.1 s and 33.3 s), so nothing was wrong
 *  with the model, the account or the transport. What never came back was the EVIDENCE.
 *
 *  ⚠⚠⚠ THE DEFECT WAS THE ABSENCE OF A CLOCK, NOT THE PRESENCE OF A LOOP. There is no runaway
 *  recursion and no unbounded retry anywhere in that path; every ceiling the loop had counted
 *  something (steps, calls, malformed replies) and NONE of them measured time. Between 「Atlas chose
 *  a tool」 and 「the answer is drawn」 the awaits with no deadline of any kind were:
 *
 *      js/atlas-agent.js        await execute(call)              — and one step may carry eight
 *      js/atlas-toolsurface.js  await runAction(built.action)
 *      js/atlas-console.js      await Promise.all(jobs)          — waits for the SLOWEST source
 *      js/atlas-console.js      _fetchJSON — 3 proxies × 9 s, WALKED, clock cleared at the headers
 *      js/atlas-sources.js      _fetchText — the same ladder again
 *      js/atlas-geo-resolve.js  geocode() / _nomExtent()         — Nominatim, no signal at all
 *      js/atlas-verify.js       _atlGeocodeStrict()              — Nominatim, ×24 in a file, and
 *                                                                  the LAST await before drawing
 *
 *  Every test below drives the real module, not a copy of it.
