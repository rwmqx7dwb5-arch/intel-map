/* ============================================================================
 *  IntMap · the documents describe the repository that exists  (checks)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  「現状の Architecture.md は『現行仕様の正本』として全面的には信用できません」
 *
 *  Two separate jobs here:
 *
 *   A. Architecture.md is a CURRENT-STATE specification again — 1,600 lines describing what
 *      the app is, with the round-by-round history removed to DEV-NOTES.md where it belongs.
 *      The mechanical property that keeps it that way is "no round references in the file".
 *
 *   B. The facts written down in MORE THAN ONE document are machine-compared, both with the
 *      repository and with each other (`scripts/doc-facts.mjs`). A fact in two places rots in
 *      one place at a time, and the reader who opens the stale copy is simply misled.
 *
 *  ⚠ AND THE GATE MUST NOT BE BLIND. The failure this repository keeps meeting is an
 *    instrument that is green because its population is empty. So the tests below check that
 *    every rule actually REPORTED, that the sweep reached the tree, and — with a throw-away
 *    document — that a violation really does fail the gate.
