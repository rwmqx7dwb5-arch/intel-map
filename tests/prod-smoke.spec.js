/* ══ ⚠⚠⚠ (#R458) THIS FILE IS NO LONGER `mode: 'serial'`, AND MEASURING SAID WHY ═══════════════
   Serial mode was here because the tests share one page, built once in `beforeAll`. It does not
   do that job — `beforeAll` does — and what it DID do was throw away the verdicts underneath the
   first red one. MEASURED on the post-deploy smoke of run 32818517323: one assertion failed and
   the four tests after it (the forecast axis, #R398's units, #R398's isobars and #R333's CORS
   contract) reported 「did not run」, so a deploy shipped with four of its checks unasked. This is
   not new — the note in tests/r287-checks.test.mjs ⑧ is about the same cascade hiding a SECOND
   real defect for a whole round.

   ⚠ SERIAL DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINST THE SITE BEING DOWN. That case never reaches a test at all:
   `beforeAll` below does the goto and the boot wait, and if production is not answering it THROWS,
   which fails every test in the file with the real reason regardless of mode. Everything serial
   was still suppressing was therefore an INDEPENDENT verdict about a page that had already booted.

   MEASURED with a four-test probe (one `beforeAll`, test #2 forced to fail, `retries: 3`, this
   config's settings) — the whole reason this is a change and not a preference:
       mode: 'serial'   beforeAll ×4, test #1 re-run on all four attempts, tests #3 and #4 NEVER RUN
       default          beforeAll ×5, only test #2 re-run, tests #3 and #4 RUN and pass
   Default mode is also the cheaper of the two here: the cyclone test is the 16th of 24, so serial
   was re-running fifteen live-network tests on each of its three retries in order to reach it.

   ⚠ Tests within a file still run IN ORDER, IN ONE WORKER. That is Playwright's default for a
   file — `fullyParallel` is not set in playwright.prod.config.js — so the shared `page` and the
   order the tests were written in are exactly as before. On a failure the worker is replaced and
   the remaining tests get a freshly booted page, which is if anything a cleaner state than the one
   they inherited before. */

/* ══ (#R209) THE CHUNKS NOBODY DOWNLOADS AT BOOT ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
   Eight feature modules left the boot bundle this round. That reproduces the exact failure this
   file exists to catch, one layer deeper: a chunk missing from the CDN leaves the page booting,
   every assertion above green, and the feature gone until somebody clicks it — and because nothing
   at boot touches those files, nothing at boot can notice. The old MODULE_GLOBALS entries could not
   have caught it either; they were boot-time presence checks.
   So beforeAll asks the loader for all of them (what a click does) and this is where the answer is
   read. Three readings, because the failures they catch are different:
     · the loader's OWN record — written by the load path, not by this test: it checks that the
       factory registered AND that the global the module owns actually appeared;
     · those globals, read from outside the loader, so a loader that lies is not self-certifying;
     · the deployed entry's LAZY_FACTORIES against the deployed loader's list, so a half-propagated
       deployment (new src/main.js with an old js/lazy-modules.js, or the reverse) is not silently

   was 「Target page, context or browser has been closed」, 「field did not load」, 「no metadata」,

   The absence was upstream: Open-Meteo had retired the CDN host the build read from, and its DNS name
   no longer existed. Nothing in the repository had changed since the last green run.
   So this asks the precondition ON ITS OWN, of the host the DEPLOYED build names (read out of the
   page, not spelled here — the spelling lives in js/wx-models.js and nowhere else): does the name
   resolve and answer the model's metadata, does it let THIS origin read it, and does it serve the
   ranged reads the field decoder is made of. Each line fails with the URL and the status in it, so
   the next time the host moves, the first red line says 「host」 rather than 「browser」. */

     only version of this worth asserting: anything looser passes while half the planet is grey.

     ⚠⚠⚠ (#R287) …AND WHAT MUST BE EXACT IS THE COLOUR, WHICH IS NOT THE SAME CLAIM AS 「the entry
     for the value at this point」. #R284 resampled the same seventeen anchors onto 0.1 m/s so the
     wind would be a gradient rather than seventeen flat bands, and that quietly removed the
     accident this assertion had been resting on: the pixel is painted from a raster TEXEL through
     `raster-resampling: linear`, so it answers for the patch of atmosphere it covers, while
     `valueNow()` answers for the mathematical point at its centre. Under seventeen bands those two
     readings landed in the same band and produced the same colour; at 0.1 m/s they are one to eight
     visible steps apart. MEASURED against production, 78 of 81 sampled pixels are EXACTLY a table
     entry — but only 20 of those 78 (26 %) are the entry for the point value, so the old form had
     become a coin flip that failed two deployments on a picture that was right.

     The ambiguity is SPATIAL, so it is settled in space and the colour stays byte-exact — the same
     move #R276 追記3 made for the eyewall pair, for the same reason: tightening a number until a
     correct picture passes is how a test stops meaning anything. Two exact claims replace one:
       ① the pixel IS one of the table's colours          → nothing was multiplied over the raster
                                                             (0.36× lands 128 RGB units away)
       ② the speed that entry stands for is a speed the
          field really takes under that pixel             → it is THIS field, here, now.

       What stood here walked the ±1.5° box from its south-west corner and STOPPED at the first
       point at or below 0.6 × peak, calling that the eye. A median 48 % of the box is below that
       line — up to 93 % of it — so the first hit is the corner the walk starts at: MEASURED over
       the 145 forecast hours production was serving on 2026-08-25, it returned exactly
       `peak.la - 1.5, peak.lo - 1.5` in 94 of the 101 hours that had an eye, a median 222 km from
       the storm, at a median 15.45 m/s of ordinary trade wind. The test's name, the camera below
       and every failure message it has ever printed were about a point outside the cyclone.
       ⚠ AND IT IS ONE SIDE OF THE OVERLAP #R458 HAD TO WORK AROUND: 「eyeFoot[1] >= 15.5」 is the
       footprint of that trade wind, not of an eye, and the eye this now names runs a median
       5.24 m/s. The pair-picking below still earns its keep — the EYEWALL's footprint straddles

           the z5 tiles landed      (1.2 s on)    the pixel paints 46.2 m/s
       and with the CPU throttled 10× — a shared two-core runner is in that range — the tiles do
       not land until **11.4 s**, i.e. long after the old 6 s had passed. What production actually
       read on the failing run was 38.1 m/s: coarser than either, an even earlier state of the same

     reads the middle of the map at z3 over open ocean and the pixel is byte-identical to the table
     entry — that is the invariant this round exists for and it holds. THIS pair is read at z5 across
     an EYEWALL, the steepest gradient in the atmosphere, where one screen pixel covers several model
     cells and MapLibre's `raster-resampling: linear` blends them: MEASURED in production, the eye
     came out one filtered step away from the 13.2 m/s entry and the assertion failed on a picture
     that was plainly right. Tightening a number until a correct picture passes is how a test stops
     meaning anything, so the QUESTION changed instead: each pixel had to be nearer its OWN table
     entry — `getColor(valueNow(...))` — than the other one's.

     ══ ⚠⚠⚠ (#R382) …AND THAT QUESTION IS STILL A POINT QUESTION ASKED OF A PATCH ═══════════════
     It is the very comparison #R287 measured and replaced one test above, kept here because at the
     time both readings happened to land near the same colour. They stopped. MEASURED on the deploy
     of 2026-08-24, which failed four attempts running:
         eyewall pixel [144,104,178] = the table's entry for 38.1 m/s
         `valueNow` at the same point                       49.61 m/s   → entry [223,214,158]
         the eye's entry (19.2 m/s)                                       [171,79,138]
     …and 38.1's colour is 2,954 from the EYE's entry and 18,741 from its own, so the pixel was
     "nearer the other one's" and the test went red on a picture that contained the storm. Read
     back through the ramp, the failure screenshot's own pixels reach 52 m/s in a pale core at the
     eyewall: the map was right.
     TWO things were wrong, and both are the test's:
       ① it read before the tiles of the new view had landed — see the wait above; and
       ② `valueNow()` answers for a mathematical POINT while the pixel answers for the PATCH of
          atmosphere it covers. Over open ocean those differ by a step or two. Across an eyewall
          the ±1.5 px patch spans **45.2 … 50.7 m/s** (measured, that hour) — and RGB DISTANCE
          ALONG THIS RAMP DOES NOT ORDER SPEEDS, which is #R276 追記's own lesson (「red − blue is
          not monotone along this ramp」) one layer up: reading the distance out of the table
          instead of inventing it did not make it monotone. The ramp loops through colour space,
          so MEASURED on the shipped table **195 of its 1,041 entries are nearer the EYE's colour
          than the EYEWALL's while being nearer the EYEWALL in speed** — and 38.1 m/s is one of
          them. A comparison decided by that is not measuring the picture.
     So the ambiguity is settled IN SPACE, exactly as #R287 settled it — `readPixel()` carried out
     whole, no tolerance anywhere in it — and the structural claim is then made in the field's own
     unit rather than in RGB: the speed the EYEWALL's pixel stands for is above everything the model
     has under the EYE, and the eye's below everything under the eyewall. Both bounds are read off
     the field. Nothing here is chosen.
     ⚠ (#R458) Nothing in the VERDICT is chosen — that is still true. WHICH TWO POINTS the verdict
     is taken at now is, because at some hours no two points can carry it. See below. */
  /* ══ ⚠⚠⚠ (#R458) …AND THE PAIR ITSELF HAS TO BE ONE THE CLAIM CAN BE MADE ABOUT ═════════════
     Claim ③ below compares one pixel against the OTHER point's footprint. That is a question
     about the picture only while the two footprints are disjoint in speed. When they overlap —
     eye.foot[1] >= ring.foot[0] — the two halves contradict each other by construction and a
     correct render can fail them, which is what happened four attempts running on the deploy of

           4.7 m/s [77,143,131] vs 27.6 m/s [76,117,145]   RGB 29.5 → 「the same colour」, ΔE00 20.56

   「海面気圧レイヤーのカーソル読み出しが、自分の凡例と100倍食い違っている。」

   `pressure_msl` arrives in PASCALS and the SDK's ramp for it is written in hPa, so the corner
   printed 「101237 hPa」, the raster was painted the ramp's last colour EVERYWHERE (getColor gives
   one answer for every value on Earth once they are all past the top breakpoint), and the isobars
   — contoured at that same ramp's breakpoints — found no level to cross and drew nothing at all.
   Nothing in the app was in a position to notice: one variable in a unit its own key is not
   written in has no second case to disagree with.

   So this asks the relation of EVERY ECMWF raster the build ships, from the layer table itself,
   and it asks it of the LIVE field rather than of the source:

     ① the value the module reports lands on the key beside it — with a whole ramp-width of
        headroom either side, so a genuinely extreme hour cannot trip it and a factor of 100 cannot
        survive it;
     ② the renderer's ramp and the reader's ramp are one declared factor apart — not two tables;
     ③ where the field's own values vary at all, the colours they resolve to must vary too. That is
        the flat-sheet symptom stated without naming a colour: a field that spans a range and paints
        one colour is a ramp being read in the wrong unit. (A field that does NOT vary — a dry hour
        of precipitation — asserts nothing, which is why this cannot be flaky.) */

/* (#R333) THE TWO HALVES OF ONE COMMIT, DEPLOYED BY DIFFERENT MEANS.
   js/ reaches production by pushing to main (deploy.yml → Pages). An Edge Function reaches it only

   #R318 shipped the `x-intmap-turn` header on both sides of that line — and only one side arrived.
   A custom request header the server does not list in Access-Control-Allow-Headers fails the
   browser's PREFLIGHT, so the POST is never sent: fetch() rejects with a bare "Failed to fetch" and
   no HTTP status ever reaches the client. Atlas answered every question that way, and every
   check in this repository stayed green, because the repository was self-consistent — js/ sent the
   header and ai-proxy's source allowed it. Only production disagreed.

   ⚠ THIS ASSERTION CANNOT MOVE INTO THE HERMETIC SUITE. Comparing the repo against itself is what
   was already true while Atlas was down. It has to ask production what it actually allows. */
