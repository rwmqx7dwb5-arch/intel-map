/* ============================================================================
 *  R464 — GDELT WAS UNREACHABLE, AND EVERY CLOCK POINTED AT IT WAS TOO SHORT TO NOTICE
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  #R452 gave Atlas's evidence gathering deadlines. Production verification then measured ONE
 *  `analyze` turn spending ~45 s on GDELT for ZERO BYTES, three times over — 8.0 s x3 of relay
 *  racing plus direct attempts of 6.1 / 7.0 / 6.7 s. The deadlines were working perfectly. What was
 *  wrong was the number in them, and the sentence that justified it:
 *
 *      js/atlas-deadlines.js  「the browser-visible CORS refusal … costs nothing, because it
 *                              rejects before a byte moves」
 *
 *  That is true of a rejected PRE-FLIGHT. GDELT's refusal is a real 429 that merely carries no
 *  ACAO, so the browser waits out the whole round trip first. MEASURED 2026-08-25 from the live
 *  origin, 18 direct attempts: 4 succeeded (22.2%), median success 17,454 ms, median refusal
 *  12,297 ms — and across 15 further samples from two different egress IPs the fastest response
 *  GDELT gave of ANY kind was 10.7 s. `DIRECT_TIMEOUT_MS = 6000` could not reach it once. The
 *  6.1 / 7.0 / 6.7 s in the report are that deadline firing, not anything GDELT did.
 *
 *  Three defects, and each check below drives the real thing rather than reading it:
 *
 *    1. the direct clock was shorter than the host's fastest possible answer          (② ⑤)
 *    2. `wLeft()` was COMPUTED before every GDELT call and never handed to one, so a
 *       「20 s」 web budget bought three sequential 14 s attempts = 42 s               (③ ④)
 *    3. there was nowhere for an answer to be REMEMBERED, so every reader paid the
 *       upstream cost of a host that refuses ~80% of requests                          (① ⑥ ⑦ ⑧)
