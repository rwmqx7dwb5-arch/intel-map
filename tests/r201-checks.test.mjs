/* ============================================================================
 *  IntMap · #R201 — a terminator with as many levels as it has pixels, a region label that
 *                   answers, a zoom that keeps going, and a suite that boots once
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Four subjects, each pinned by the PROPERTY that was missing rather than by the line that fixes it:
 *
 *    ① 「夜と昼の部分の変遷が階段状で不自然」/「夜の部分は完全に夜間光レイヤーと同じ画像に」
 *       Five nested fills can produce five levels. The night side is now ONE canvas whose alpha is
 *       computed per pixel, and whose RGB is the GIBS product with nothing done to it.
 *    ② 「クリック可能ではない！ほかの地名ラベルと違う挙動にするな！」 #R198 left `ofm-admin1` out of
 *       js/map-ui.js's label lists on purpose and wrote that down. It is in ALL of them now — and
 *       "all of them" is checked by DERIVING the lists from the file, not by naming them here.
 *    ③ 「ボタンで押す形式ではなく…ズームアウトし続ければそのまま宇宙まで」 No button; an integral.
 *    ④ 「毎回毎回、テストに時間がかかりすぎ」 Eight specs booted the app TWICE per test to choose a
 *       renderer. One boot now — and no spec may go back to two without this test noticing.
