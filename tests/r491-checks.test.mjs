 *
 *  Two things make that feature either work or be pointless, and both are checkable here.
 *
 *  ① WHAT THE MODEL IS SHOWN. The card's whole claim over a browser dictionary is `inContext` —
 *     which Georgia, which flank, which article. That answer exists only if the PASSAGE reaches
 *     the model, and a long answer has to be clipped. Clipping it from the FRONT would drop the
 *     paragraph a phrase near the end lives in, i.e. exactly the paragraph that could answer the
 *     question, and nothing on screen would say so — the card would simply be vaguer. ①–③ drive
 *     the SHIPPED functions with data, through the factory that uses them.
 *
 *  ② WHOSE DAY IT SPENDS. A lookup runs on public.ai_gloss_usage, not on the reader's ten daily
 *     questions. That separation is made of four small facts, and every one of them can be
 *     un-made by a plausible edit: the lane header must be VERIFIED against the parsed task
 *     (or it is a free door into `atlas_turn`), the gloss reply must not carry `used`/`limit`
 *     (or js/ai-core.js mirrors the gloss count into the QUESTION counter), the entry point must
 *     not gate on the question quota (or the lane is blocked by the thing it exists to avoid),
 *     and a failed lookup must refund the counter it charged. ④–⑧ pin all four.
 *
 *  ⚠ THE WIRING CHECKS READ THE SOURCES THROUGH `codeOnly`, so this file's own prose — and the
 *  modules' — can never be what a check matches (#R345).
