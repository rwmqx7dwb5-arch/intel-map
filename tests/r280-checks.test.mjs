/* ============================================================================
 *  #R280 — 「文書が多すぎる」の診断を検証して実装した回の回帰テスト
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  この回の主張は「文書と実装が食い違っていた」であり、その主張は**測れる**。したがって
 *  ここで検査するのは文章の見た目ではなく、次の3つである:
 *
 *    ① 新しく足した `check:docs` のルールが、実際に**落ちる**こと。
 *       規則を書いただけの検査は、何も見ていなくても緑になる（#R274 ②と同じ形）。
 *       各ルールについて、そのルールが禁じている状態を一時的に作り、`--check` が exit 1 で
 *       落ち、かつ**そのルール名を印字する**ことを確かめる。
 *    ② 移設で**情報が消えていない**こと。節番号を共有したまま別ファイルへ移したので、
 *       他の文書からの `§3.x` / `§7.x` 参照が生きていること、リンク先が実在すること。
 *    ③ 法務文面の**写しが1つ**であること——モーダルと公開2ページが同じ1本を読むこと。

/* ⚠ (#R286) THE ANCHORS IN § ② ARE WRITTEN WITH LF, AND THIS CHECKOUT MAY NOT BE.
   `.gitattributes` pins only the extensions Linux executes (*.sh *.sql *.mjs *.yml *.yaml *.toml);
   *.html and *.md are left to `core.autocrlf`, which is `true` on the development machine. So
   `privacy.html`'s `…legal-text.js"></script>` is followed by CRLF here and by LF in CI, and the
   `legal` case demanded LF — red on Windows, green in CI, for a reason that is not its subject.
   That is #R283's finding in a fourth file; #R274, #R279 and #R282 each re-diagnosed the first
   three by hand, which is the cost of leaving one.
   ⚠ THE TEXT IS NOT NORMALISED, AND THAT IS THE POINT. § ② writes each file back byte for byte to
   restore it, so normalising what it READS would rewrite the working copy's line endings as a side
   effect of running the tests. The ANCHOR is widened instead: a line break in the pattern matches
   this checkout's line break and NOTHING else is relaxed — every other character is escaped, so an
   anchor that has genuinely gone is still a failure (tests/r286-checks ⑥ proves both directions). */
