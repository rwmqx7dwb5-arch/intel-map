 *  IntMap · #R304 — source-level checks
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  The round is about a tier of tests that ran every night, went red, and told nobody — and about
 *  two assertions inside it that were COPIES of facts rather than statements about them.
 *
 *    · js/lazy-modules.js knew eight modules when tests/r209.spec.js was written and ten by #R291.
 *      The spec said `toBe(8)`. It had been failing every night since the round that made it ten.
 *    · #R296 deleted three simulators on the user's instruction. tests/r166.spec.js went on
 *      demanding the globals they used to publish, and tests/r197.spec.js went on opening one of
 *      them. Both had been failing every night since that round.
 *    · The nightly itself was red on all fourteen runs from 2026-08-08 to 08-21 and `browser-gate`
 *      reported it honestly every time. Nobody was lied to; nobody looked.
 *
 *  So what is pinned here is (a) that the derivations those specs now read really do track their
 *  sources, and (b) that the nightly's verdict reaches a reader — an issue, and the command every
 *  session runs before it starts.
 *
 *  ⚠ THESE RUN IN `npm test`. A check that lives in a tier nobody watches is the disease, not the
 *  cure — which is why this file is in package.json's `test:checks` list in the same commit that
 *  creates it.
