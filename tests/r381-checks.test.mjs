/* ============================================================================
 *  #R381 — finishing the two world wars
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  #R349 built the machinery for a day-by-day record of both wars and then filled about half of it
 *  in: five fronts and 24 dated lines for WW1, eight and 36 for WW2, and eighteen and thirty-six
 *  operations between them. Serbia, the Caucasus, Mesopotamia and Romania had no line at all; nor
 *  did Norway, Albania, Greece or Burma; the Pacific — which by design has no front and therefore
 *  has ONLY operations — had five of them. The gazetteer it shipped names every one of those
 *  theatres, and 178 of its 408 anchors were quoted by nothing.
 *
 *  ⚠ EVERY CHECK HERE READS data/wars.json AND RUNS js/war-geom.js — the shipped file through the
 *  code the browser paints with. #R349's lesson stands: the defect this round could ship is a front
 *  drawn the right shape and the wrong way round, and that looks exactly like a correct one. Nine of
 *  those were found by the build's own audit while this round was being written, INCLUDING ONE
 *  #R349 SHIPPED — the Battle of France, whose sides were declared back to front for its whole span,
 *  so that on 25 May 1940 the map put Paris, Lyon and Bordeaux under the Wehrmacht.
 *
 *  ⚠ AND THEY ARE READ THROUGH `readLF` where they are read as text, for the reason #R283 gives.

     year the author stopped writing. Four discontinuous conflicts arrived in #R519 and the same loop
     began demanding a front line in 1952 — the twenty months after the truce line was agreed at
     Panmunjom, when the front divided neither Korea and `control` alone carried the two colours —
     and in every one of the twenty-two years the Middle East was not at war.
     ⚠ THE FIX IS NOT TO WEAKEN THIS. Filling those years would mean writing lines for days nobody
     recorded, which is the one thing scripts/wars/lang.mjs refuses. So this keeps saying exactly what
