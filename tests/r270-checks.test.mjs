 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Eight reports in one round. The assertions below are about the PROPERTIES that make each defect
 *  impossible again — never about the literals this round happened to write.
 *
 *    ① the terrain & water panel opened underneath the sidebar, in a z-band this app does not have
 *    ② the layer-search ✕ was a character no family in this app's stack draws
 *    ③ the World-Bank keys drew a staircase for layers that paint a gradient
 *    ④ the year is on the layer, for every layer whose year means something
 *    ⑤ one fill for four South-Slavic standards made the colour key read 「セルビア語」
 *    ⑥ three rows were on the wrong shelf; two layers shared one name
 *    ⑦ 「day/night off」 was being read as 「the Sun's position is unknown」
 *    ⑧ two scales shared one palette, and the key named the other one
