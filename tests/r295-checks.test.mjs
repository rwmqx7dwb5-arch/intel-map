 *  IntMap · #R295 source checks — the standing operating configuration
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  「今後、このIntMapリポジトリで新しいClaude Codeセッションを開始した場合、セッションに関係なく、
 *    私が普通に自然言語で開発要求を出すだけで、Claude自身が可能な限り高速・安全・高品質に作業を
 *    進める状態にしてください。」「私にworktree、subagent、agent設定などの手動管理を要求しない。」
 *
 *  #R295 put that state into the official mechanisms: ONE always-on rule
 *  (.agents/rules/execution-strategy.md), five subagents (.claude/agents/), one skill
 *  (.claude/skills/intmap-round/), a SessionStart hook, and scripts/worktree.mjs.
 *
 *  This file measures the configuration, because a configuration is a set of CLAIMS ABOUT THE
 *  REPOSITORY and every one of them can go stale silently (#R278: 規則を文章で書いたら、その規則を
 *  測る検査を同じラウンドで書く):
 *
 *    · a command named in a rule but deleted from scripts/ still READS correctly — §③/§④
 *    · an agent whose `name` stops matching its filename is simply never delegated to — §①
 *    · the always-on rule is context every session pays for, so it has a CEILING — §⑥
 *    · a checks file that is not in `test:checks` is green for ever (#R260 ⑥) — §⑧
 *    · a merge into settings.json that silently drops the pre-existing deny rule — §⑤
 *
 *  ⚠ CONTENT ASSERTIONS NORMALISE LINE ENDINGS (#R283). core.autocrlf=true locally, LF in CI.
 *  ⚠ COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED BEFORE SEARCHING EXECUTABLE FILES. This round's own prose quotes the
 *    things it forbids, and a check that reads its own explanation has now happened 19 times.

/* ── ⑯ THE VERIFICATION LADDER HAS EXACTLY ONE OWNER ───────────────────────────────────────────
   R295's first draft stated the stage table three times — in the rule, in intmap-verifier.md and
   in the skill — while the rule was declared the 正本 by AGENTS.md and docs/README.md. An audit
   of the round found it; this is the gate so the next round cannot re-introduce it.
   The signature of the table is a STAGE NUMBER BOUND TO A COMMAND (「段 3」 beside `npm test`,
   「段0」 beside `node --test`). One file may carry that; the others must link. */
