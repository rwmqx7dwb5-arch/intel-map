/* ============================================================================
 *  #R260 — the session has an END, and the end is written down
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  「定例指示に追加して。作業終了処理…」— until this round AGENTS.md described how to
 *  do the work and stopped at `branch deletion`. What happens AFTER the work was
 *  carried in the user's head and pasted when it mattered: commit and push, then
 *  mirror the site onto the backup USB stick, once a calendar day, and VERIFY the
 *  mirror instead of trusting that the copy returned 0.
 *
 *  This file exists for the same reason tests/r257-checks.test.mjs does: AGENTS.md
 *  is a document nobody executes, so a rule can vanish from it and every later
 *  round will run happily without ever noticing. Three things in particular are
 *  load-bearing and silent when broken:
 *
 *    · the DIRECTION (`PC → USB`, never the reverse). A round that softens this
 *      into "sync" makes the backup a second working copy, and the first conflict
 *      overwrites real work with a stale mirror.
 *    · the VERIFICATION. "robocopy exited 1" is not "the backup is good"; the rule
 *      is a recursive hash comparison with a zero-difference result.
 *    · the ONE-A-DAY ledger and the rule that its date only moves on SUCCESS. A
 *      round that stamps the date first and syncs after turns one failed backup
 *      into a whole day of skipped ones.
