/* ============================================================================
 *  IntMap · ENTRY — the module graph that replaced sixty <script src> tags  (#R175)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Every file below used to be a CLASSIC <script src="js/…"> in index.html, executed in document order
 *  at parse time. They are ES modules now, imported here in the IDENTICAL order — and that swap is safe
 *  for a mechanically checked reason rather than a hopeful one: an AST sweep of all 58 files finds ZERO
 *  top-level declarations, and therefore zero cross-file lexical dependencies. Every one of them is a
 *  pure side-effect module that publishes itself on `window` and reads its collaborators back off
 *  `window` / IM_HOST — the discipline the #R162–#R169 splits established. A module's top-level
 *  `const`/`function` is module-PRIVATE where a classic script's is global, so having none of either is
 *  exactly the property that makes this conversion incapable of changing a single name resolution.
 *  tests/r175-checks.test.mjs re-runs that sweep on every commit, so it cannot quietly stop being true.
 *
 *  ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING — several files call factories an earlier file registered on
 *  window.IntMapModules — and the same test pins this list against index.html's own module-check list.
 *
 *  Boot sequence, unchanged in effect: a type="module" script is deferred, so this runs after the
 *  document is parsed and BEFORE DOMContentLoaded fires. That is exactly when the classic tags used to
 *  finish, and exactly what index.html's main body waits for.
 * ==========================================================================*/

/* ── (#R209) …AND THE ONES THAT ARE NOT HERE YET, ON PURPOSE ────────────────────────────────────
   These files are not in the import list above: they are fetched by js/lazy-modules.js the
   first time the user reaches for the feature. The guard below therefore CANNOT check them at boot
   — `typeof M[k] !== 'function'` is the correct answer for a module nobody has asked for, and
   reporting it would make every clean boot look broken.
   ⚠ THE CHECK IS NOT DROPPED, IT IS MOVED. js/lazy-modules.js verifies, at the moment each one
   lands, that the factory registered AND that the global it owns was published, and records any
   failure in window.__imLazyCheck.failed — which tests/r209.spec.js asserts is empty after asking
   for every one of them. Naming them here keeps ONE list of every factory the program has, so a
   file that is deleted or renamed still has somewhere to be missing from. (#R311) six more.
   ⚠ (#R322) …and five that are HALVES of a factory that is still eager. `timeSeries`, `aiResearch`,
   `correlate`, `worldEvents` and `edu` stay in MODULE_FACTORIES above, because js/analysis-panels.js
   still registers all five at boot — it is their BODIES that moved, into the five `analysis*` keys
   below, and the boot guard cannot see those for the same reason it cannot see the others.
   (#R341) …and `aviationLive`, which carries the whole live-aircraft platform: the controller, the
   GPU primitive it imports, and the worker that owns the fleet. Nothing of it is downloaded until
   the aircraft layer, aircraft search or an Atlas aviation command asks for it. (#R353) …and the two volcano modules — see js/lazy-modules.js and docs/VOLCANO-INTELLIGENCE.md. (#R354) …and the three company-atlas modules — docs/COMPANIES.md §3. */
