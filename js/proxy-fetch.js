/*  IntMap · Fetching a document through a CORS proxy  (#R212)
 *
 *  Lifted out of js/app-body.js, which is at its #R200 line ceiling and whose subject is not
 *  «how to get an RSS document from a host that sends no ACAO header».
 *
 *  ══ A RACE WITH NO CLOCK IS NOT A RACE ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  「ニュースが表示されるまでが遅い。ずっと読み込み中。」 MEASURED on a real load of this build:
 *  corsproxy.io answered in 4 ms with a valid 203 KB feed, api.allorigins.win took 19.5 s and
 *  api.codetabs.com 20.0 s — and neither was ever given up on. `Promise.any` resolves on the first
 *  SUCCESS, so a good day was fine; the bad day is what the report describes. When the fast proxy is
 *  the one that fails, the race waits ~20 s for the slow two, and the sequential fallback then re-ran
 *  ALL THREE with no timeout either (a measured 35.5 s for one of them). Minutes of 「読み込み中」,
 *  with the sockets held the whole time — a phone has six per host, and #R201 measured what queued
 *  connections do to the imagery.
 *
 *  So: every attempt carries a deadline, the losers are ABORTED the moment one wins, and the
 *  fallback is one bounded pass. WHICH proxies are used is unchanged; they are simply given a clock.
 *
 *  ⚠ ONE EXPORT, and everything else is inside it. tests/r175-checks ③ requires that a js/ module has
 *  no unexported top-level declaration AND no export nobody imports — so the constants and the two
 *  helpers live in the closure rather than becoming five names the rule would have to police.

  /* ══ (#R214) WHY THERE IS A FOURTH ONE, AND WHY IT IS THE ODD ONE OUT ═══════════════════════════
     「日本語版でニュースが表示されない。ずっと読み込み中。」 Measured FROM THE PAGE (#R188), same
     build, same second, the two WORLD feeds side by side through the three proxies above:

        feed        allorigins      corsproxy.io                      codetabs
        en-US       timeout 9 s     200 · 171 KB · valid RSS · 5 ms   timeout 9 s
        ja-JP       timeout 9 s     503 · Google's "Sorry..." page    timeout 9 s

     So it was never the app's Japanese path: GOOGLE serves the en-US edition to that proxy's egress
     and refuses the ja/JP one — its bot interstitial, byte-identical (2,041 B) for WORLD, BUSINESS,
     the plain feed and search. With the only reachable proxy blocked for that ONE locale, the race
     had nothing left to win with, and a Japanese reader waited out the full ~40 s of deadlines to be
     told it failed. ⚠ A proxy that works is not a proxy that works FOR EVERY TARGET.

     proxy.corsfix.com answers all five editions with real RSS and the right locale in the titles
     (jp 238 ms / en 537 / de 857 / ru 742 / es 1,277 ms, measured in that order on this build).
     ⚠ IT TAKES THE URL RAW. Handed an encodeURIComponent'd one it returns 400 with a 247-byte body —
     which is why this list is a list of FUNCTIONS and not a list of prefixes. */
  /* ══ ⚠⚠ (#R216) …AND THE FOURTH ONE WAS VERIFIED ON THE WRONG ORIGIN ═══════════════════════════
     Reported a third time, word for word. #R214's table above was taken on `http://127.0.0.1`.
     Re-measured from the REAL site (`https://rwmqx7dwb5-arch.github.io`), same build, same second:

        proxy.corsfix.com  → 403  {"corsfix_error":"domain_not_registered"}   255 ms
        corsproxy.io       → 503  Google's "Sorry…" page (ja-JP only)         8.1 s
        api.allorigins.win → timeout                                          >20 s
        api.codetabs.com   → timeout                                          >20 s

     corsfix authorises by CALLING ORIGIN — localhost is allowed by default and a deployed domain
     has to be registered with them — so the one relay that could read Japanese worked in
     development and was refused in production. Every Japanese reader of the live site waited out
     the full ~40 s of deadlines and was told it failed. ⚠ A relay verified from localhost is not a
     relay verified for the site; the origin is part of the request.

     The first entry is now OUR OWN Edge Function (supabase/functions/news-relay), the same answer
     #R145 gave for the Street-View tiles and #R190 for the submarine cables: fetch it server-side,
     where browser CORS does not apply, and hand it back with ACAO. Measured from production —
     jp 1,111 ms / 70 items, en 1,308 / 45, de 1,145 / 70, ru 1,326 / 70, es 1,290 / 70. The four
     public relays stay BEHIND it: a cold function or a Supabase outage still falls back to exactly
     the behaviour this file had before.
     ⚠ `window.SUPABASE_URL` is read AT CALL TIME, not when this module is evaluated — src/vendor.js
     may not have run yet, and a base captured as '' would delete the relay for the whole session. */

     news-relay can ride inside `race()` because Google News answers in ~700 ms, comfortably inside
     one racer's 8 s. gdelt-relay cannot: on a cache MISS it is waiting on api.gdeltproject.org,
     whose fastest measured response of any kind is 10.7 s. Raced at 8 s it would be aborted every
     time the cache was cold — i.e. exactly when the upstream read that FILLS the cache is in
     flight — and the cache would never warm. So it is tried first, alone, with a clock sized to the
     thing it is actually waiting for.

     ⚠ AND IT IS TRIED BEFORE `direct`, WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF THE OTHER HOSTS. Measured from the
     live site, 18 direct attempts at GDELT: 4 succeeded (22.2%), median success 17,454 ms. Trying

  /* ══ ⚠⚠⚠ (#R446) THE ONLY ANSWER THIS FILE ACCEPTED WAS A FEED, AND ONE CALLER ASKS FOR A PAGE ══
     js/article-reader.js's second strategy hands `item.link` — a news ARTICLE's URL — to this
     function and parses the result as HTML. An article page contains neither `<rss` nor `<feed`, so
     `isFeed` refused it; Strategy 2 could not succeed, it could only take twenty seconds to fail.

     MEASURED from the live site (https://rwmqx7dwb5-arch.github.io, 2026-08-25), the two article
     URLs on the front page that day, through this exact ladder:

        corsfix       403                                                    986 ms / 320 ms
        corsproxy.io  200 · text/html · 217,509 B (dw.com)   → «not feed»   3,362 ms
        corsproxy.io  200 · text/html · 198,238 B (aljazeera) → «not feed»  1,087 ms
        allorigins    aborted at its 8 s deadline
        codetabs      aborted at its 8 s deadline
        …then the bounded pass fetched the SAME page again (8 ms / 21 ms, from the HTTP cache) and
        rejected it a second time.
        TOTAL 20,313 ms and 20,355 ms — and `null` both times.

     The article arrived, twice, and was thrown away, twice.

     ⚠⚠ AND THE FIX IS NOT «ACCEPT WHATEVER CAME BACK». #R216 made news-relay answer 502 for
     Google's HTML interstitial on the grounds that 「an interstitial is not a feed」; the same rule
     holds one layer out. A relay's own error page IS HTML, and a reader that draws somebody else's
     error message as the article body is worse than a reader that says it could not fetch one —
     #R446 measured that exact failure happening already, in the reader's FIRST strategy.
     So `as:'html'` accepts an HTML DOCUMENT THAT IS NOT A STUB, and nothing else:

       · it declares itself HTML (`<!doctype html` / `<html`) — which is also what rules out the
         relays' JSON error envelopes, measured at 314 B of `{"corsfix_error":…}`;
       · it is at least HTML_MIN_BYTES long — measured, the relay and interstitial bodies are
         314 B, 2,041 B (#R216's Google 「Sorry…」 page) and 7,594 B, and the two real articles were
         198,238 B and 217,509 B;
       · it carries the markup the caller actually reads — a `<p>` or a description meta. A document
         with neither cannot yield a single block, so accepting it would hand back an "answer" that
         is empty by construction.

     ⚠ WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM. «Is there an ARTICLE in this page» is the caller's question, and
     the caller already asks it: js/article-reader.js requires two paragraphs of >40 characters
     before it calls the extract a body, and falls back to the page-embed mode when it cannot. This
     predicate answers only 「is this a page, or is it the relay apologising」. The non-2xx shapes
     never reach it at all — measured, every relay failure above came with 403 / 404 / 530. */

   *                  refusing to show it. A refusal that costs twelve seconds is not free, and
   *                  sizing a deadline as though it were is what made this path unusable.
