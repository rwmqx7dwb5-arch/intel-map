 *  IntMap · ATLAS — ONE OPERATION, ONE BLOCK IN THE REPLY  (#R441)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  「経路を聞いたらいくつも出てきてしまう。6つぐらい出てきた。おかしいバグ。」
 *
 *  The screenshot shows ONE question — 「ここから大阪駅まで電車で行きたい。」 — and the SAME five
 *  itineraries listed twice inside the same reply: 「5件の候補 — タップで地図に表示」, five cards,
 *  the Transitous/MOTIS footnote, and then 「5件の候補 — タップで地図に表示」 and the five cards
 *  again. Same departure, same arrival, same transfers, same selected card.
 *
 *  ══ WHY THE EXISTING GUARD DID NOT CATCH IT ══════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  A turn may run a tool more than once — that is Atlas's to decide (CONSTITUTION.md §5), and the
 *  loop in js/atlas-agent.js gives it up to 32 calls across 8 steps. What is NOT Atlas's to decide
 *  is how many times the reader is shown the same result, and js/atlas-console.js already had two
 *  guards for that:
 *
 *      · `_atlGoalKey` — de-dupe by GOAL, but it answered '' for everything except the fourteen
 *        answer/report types, so every operational action was kept unconditionally; and
 *      · «drop any exact-duplicate html fragment» — a STRING comparison of the rendered HTML.
 *
 *  The string comparison is what routing defeats. js/routing.js stamps every computed route set
 *  with a fresh id — `_rsNew()` is `'rs' + (++_rsSeq)` — and js/routing-cards.js writes that id
 *  into every card as `data-rset` so a tap on an OLD message still selects within ITS OWN set
 *  (#R291). Two runs of the same journey therefore produce two HTML fragments that differ in
 *  exactly one place: `data-rset="rs1"` vs `data-rset="rs2"`. Byte-unequal, so `seen[h]` never
 *  fires, so both are appended. The guard was reading the RENDERING when the thing that repeated
 *  was the OPERATION.
 *
 *  ══ WHAT THIS MODULE DECIDES ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  One slot per goal, where a goal is now named two ways instead of one:
 *
 *      · an ANSWER family — unchanged from #R159: the topic, so a repair REPLACES the failure it
 *        is repairing. A tie keeps the FIRST, because the answer already on the page stays.
 *      · a REPEATED OPERATION — the action's type and its arguments, or the identity the result
 *        declared for itself (`meta.resultKey`). A tie keeps the LATEST, because the app kept the
 *        latest: the map is holding the route the last run drew, and the cards the reader can tap
 *        should be that run's.
 *
 *  ⚠ `meta.resultKey` EXISTS BECAUSE THE ARGUMENTS ARE NOT ALWAYS THE SAME WORDS. 「ここから」 and
 *  the coordinates `my_location` just returned are the same starting point spelled two ways, and a
 *  turn that looks the reader up and then routes may well use one on one step and the other on the
 *  next. A case that knows what it RESOLVED can say so, and then the two runs collapse on what
 *  they actually did rather than on how they were asked.
 *
 *  ⚠ THIS TAKES NOTHING FROM ATLAS. It does not cap the loop, refuse a call, or decide whether a
 *  second route is worth computing — every tool call still runs, and the map still ends up with
 *  what the last one drew. What changes is that the reader is shown one route once, which is what
 *  the app actually did.
 *
 *  ⚠ NO DOM, NO NETWORK, NO GLOBALS — `norm` is injected — so tests/r441-checks.test.mjs drives
 *  THIS module, the one the browser runs, with no browser. That is the js/atlas-turn-continuity.js
 *  pattern, and it is also why the subject is its own file: js/atlas-console.js has a shrink-only
 *  line ceiling (tests/r318-checks.test.mjs ⓑ).
