/* ============================================================================
 *  IntMap · THE APPLICATION BODY  (#R175)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  The 496 KB `window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', …)` block that had been the last thing
 *  living inside index.html, moved out VERBATIM — not one statement reordered, renamed or reindented.
 *
 *  Two reasons, and the second is the one that made it urgent:
 *    ① Standing rule 13: index.html must stop being the program. It was 556 KB before this move and
 *       is ~60 KB after it — markup, styles and one module tag.
 *    ② A bundler cannot touch an inline <script>. Vite minifies what it can see, and this block was
 *       invisible to it, so half a megabyte of comments and whitespace shipped to every visitor on
 *       every uncached load. As a module it is minified and hashed with everything else.
 *
 *  SAFE FOR THE SAME MECHANICAL REASON AS THE js/ FILES: the block is a SINGLE expression statement
 *  with no top-level declaration of its own — every `let`/`function` in it is already inside the
 *  arrow function — so nothing it defines was ever a global, and module scope takes nothing away.
 *  (An AST sweep asserts this in tests/r175-checks.test.mjs.) It is imported LAST by src/main.js, and
 *  a type="module" script runs before DOMContentLoaded fires, so the listener below is still
 *  registered in time — the same guarantee the inline tag had.
 * ==========================================================================*/
/* (#R180) THE BOOT BARRIER — two lines, and the body below is untouched.
   A second engine cannot be installed after the app has built its view: every
   source, layer, marker and camera hook is created through whichever adapter was
   in place at `GE().ui.createView(…)`. js/engine-select.js starts loading Cesium
   before DOMContentLoaded but `import('cesium')` is asynchronous, so the choice is
   published as a PROMISE and this waits for it. With no pending engine — the
   default, and every MapLibre session — `_p` is undefined, `_imAppBoot()` runs
   synchronously on the DOMContentLoaded tick exactly as before, and there is no
   promise anywhere in the path. Wrapping rather than re-indenting is deliberate:
   the 5,000-line body below is byte-identical to #R179's, so nothing in it can
   have changed meaning. */

     `map.isStyleLoaded()`, and conflating the two was the root cause of the reported
     「レイヤーをオンオフしても、時間差で表示されたり表示されなかったりする」.

     MapLibre's isStyleLoaded() means *the style is parsed AND every source cache is fully loaded*.
     Tiles stream continuously while a user pans/zooms, so it is FALSE most of the time during
     ordinary browsing — measured on this app: FALSE for 12 of 14 samples (86%) across a 12 s pan,
     with contiguous false runs of ~2 s. Every `ensureX(){ if(!map.isStyleLoaded()) return false; … }`
     guard and whenStyleReady() therefore refused to build the layer and fell back to waiting for the
     map to go idle (or whenStyleReady's 6 s hard-resolve). Measured toggle-ON → layer painted:
     **4497 ms / 3171 ms when the map was busy vs 189 ms when it happened to be idle** — i.e. the same
     click either paints instantly or seconds later, purely by luck. Toggle-OFF has no such gate, so
     off is instant while on lags: exactly the reported asymmetry.

     addSource/addLayer only need the STYLE OBJECT to be parsed; in-flight tiles are irrelevant
     (verified: adding a source+layer while isStyleLoaded()===false succeeds and the layer is live).
     During a real setStyle() swap (Map ⇄ Satellite) the parsed flag genuinely goes false and back,
     so the guard still protects that window — it just stops firing on ordinary tile traffic. */

  /* ══ ⚠⚠⚠ (#R498) …AND #R232 ONLY MOVED THREE OF THEM ═══════════════════════════════════════════
     #R232 established the rule — 「携帯か」 is a question about the DEVICE, and a 768 px media query
     answers it wrong the moment the phone is turned sideways — and then applied it to `antialias`,
     `pixelRatio` and `maxTileCacheSize`. Everything else that is also a device question kept asking
     the WIDTH, so an iPhone in landscape (844 px) still took, all at once:
       · `_hiDPITiles` true → @2x CARTO tiles and the @2x Esri stitch: 512² per tile, FOUR times the
         pixels to decode and upload per tile, on the phone GPU #R232 had just protected;
       · `maxCanvasSize` raised to the GPU's own limit (up to 8192²) instead of the 4096² RAM guard;
       · the per-frame marker-occlusion recompute that #R33 measured as the heaviest per-move work
         and switched off on phones — back on, on every frame of every drag;
       · `_DEM_CACHE_MAX` 560 instead of 140, and the settle-time DEM viewport prefetch.
     They are one question, so they ask one predicate now, and it has the name of the question.
     ⚠ WHAT IS **NOT** MOVED, deliberately. `maxZoom` (18 on phones, 19 elsewhere) is a CAPABILITY,
     not a cost — asked, and the answer was to leave landscape at 19. Every LAYOUT test stays a width
     question because that is what it is about: `isMobile()` drives the sheet, the crosshair and the
     mobile readout, and moving those would leave a landscape phone with NO readout at all (the
     desktop one early-returns when the crosshair owns it, and the crosshair early-returns when it
     does not). `_imTouchPrimary` keeps its own name for the same reason — it answers "click or
     tap", which is a question about the POINTER, not about the GPU. */

     Bluetooth mouse paired. Those took the DESKTOP budget on the hardware this list protects.
     ⚠ The third term can only move devices INTO the phone budget, never out of one, and it asks

  /* ===== (#R163) IM_HOST — the HOST INTERFACE every split-out module receives =====
     All of this app's code lives inside ONE DOMContentLoaded closure, so the names declared at its
     top level are closure variables, NOT globals. A block moved into js/ simply loses them — and
     because soft dependencies here are written as `typeof X!=='undefined'` inside try/catch, that
     loss is SILENT: no error, the branch is just skipped and the feature quietly disappears (#R162
     lost the Area-Monitors radius capture exactly that way). So a split-out module is a FACTORY,
     called at the spot the original block occupied:
         window.IntMapX = window.IntMapModules.x(map, IM_HOST);
     and it reads everything it needs from this one object. #R162 gave js/monitors.js a private host
     object; #R163 promotes it to the project-wide convention so the next module costs nothing.

     EVERY member is a getter, deliberately, for two independent reasons:
       · LIVE — currentLang/currentUser/currentProj/currentMapType/terrain3D/radiusItems/countryGeo are
         all REASSIGNED at runtime (language switch, login, projection change, 3D toggle,
         clearAllRadius(), the boundary file finishing its load). A captured copy freezes at factory
         time and the module then reads a dead value for the rest of the session — silently.
       · LAZY — a getter body does not run until it is read, so this object can sit here near the top
         of the closure while naming `const`s and `let`s that are declared much further down
         (currentUser is ~13k lines below). No temporal-dead-zone hazard, whatever the order.
     `map` stays a separate first argument: it is assigned exactly once at boot and every module body
     refers to it by the bare name. See Architecture.md §3.1.

     (#R165) READ-WRITE members — the ONLY exception to getter-only, introduced for the Atlas kernel
     (js/atlas-console.js): Atlas actions WRITE five closure variables (theme/units/radius/measure
     state). The variable itself stays here in index.html as the single source of truth; the module
     writes THROUGH the host (`HOST.radiusKm=v` runs the setter, which assigns the closure variable),
     so index.html code and module code keep reading the same live value. Every RW member is a
     `get x(){…}, set x(v){ x=v; }` pair on ONE line; everything else stays getter-only.
     tests/r165-checks.test.mjs pins the RW list to exactly these five. */

     invisible. The right-hand layer panel builds later still (js/map-ui.js, on a 1.5 s timer), so
     the answer is published on `window` for it to read rather than pushed at it — the panel decides,
     as it already does for mobile.
     ⚠ The key is `intmap_session2`. Exactly one place WRITES it — the persistence block further down

     「48並列を撤回し、MapLibre標準の16／移動中8を基準に実機調整」. What the number does, read in
     maplibre-gl 5.24.0 rather than assumed: `config.MAX_PARALLEL_IMAGE_REQUESTS` (default 16) is the
     ceiling `processQueue` starts requests up to, and `MAX_PARALLEL_IMAGE_REQUESTS_PER_FRAME` (8) is
     the ceiling it uses instead WHILE THROTTLED — and Map registers the throttle itself
     (`ImageRequest.addThrottleControl(() => this.isMoving())`). So the 8 is already in force during
     every gesture and is not ours to set; 48 only ever applied to the STILL map.
     ⚠ WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY IT COSTS THE GESTURE. Starting a request is throttled, FINISHING one is
     not: up to 48 decodes begin while the map is still, and each one lands — decode plus GPU upload —
     whenever it lands, including in the middle of the pinch that follows. Sixteen in flight is
     sixteen landings; forty-eight is forty-eight, into the same frames.
     ⚠ NOTHING ABOUT THE PICTURE CHANGES. Same tile URLs, same zoom levels, same resolution, same
     source — only how many of them are in the air at once (「見た目は一切落とすな」).
     ⚠ THE TEST IS THE UA AND STAYS THE UA. Unlike isMobile() (a 768 px media query) this reads the
     user agent, so it is already true for an iPhone in BOTH orientations — the one device-class test
     in this file that landscape does not fall out of. Desktop keeps 256 (#R22): it is not the machine
     the instruction is about, and no measurement here says otherwise.
     ⚠ 「実機調整」 CANNOT BE DONE FROM HERE. No environment this project can automate is an iPhone, so

         #R178 and #R179 found the satellite layer and then the base map running at half the

         own defaults, and they cost resolution in exactly the situations this app is built
         for — a tilted 3-D view, and a large high-density monitor.

         ① ANISOTROPIC FILTERING, which MapLibre applies to a raster tile only when
            `transform.pitch > options.anisotropicFilterPitch`, default 20°. Read it in the
            renderer: `P.texture.useMipmap && d.extTextureFilterAnisotropic &&
            e.transform.pitch > e.options.anisotropicFilterPitch`. A surface receding from the
            camera is minified far harder along one axis than the other, and an isotropic
            sampler has to pick one mip level for both — which is why ground near the horizon
            goes to mush. Below 20° of pitch that correction was simply off, and on the GLOBE
            (the app's default projection) the surface curves away towards the limb at EVERY
            pitch, including zero. 0 turns it on wherever the GPU offers it; where there is no
            anisotropy to correct the sampler costs the same as the trilinear one it replaces.

         ② maxCanvasSize, default [4096, 4096]. MapLibre clamps the drawing buffer to it, so
            on any display whose CSS size × devicePixelRatio exceeds 4096 the canvas is
            silently scaled DOWN and the `pixelRatio` set above stops being honoured — a
            1440p screen at DPR 2 is already 5120 px wide, i.e. the common case, not an exotic
            one. Raised to the GPU's own limit (capped at 8192, and never above what it
            reports), so full device resolution survives on a large monitor. Phones keep
            4096: there the cap is a RAM guard, and 「ブラウザが落ちることがないように」 has

           「衛星画像の読み込み時の動作を、極限までシームレスにして。（高速・違和感低減・点滅軽減）」
           #R147 set this to 0 against MapLibre's 300 ms default, and it was right about the default:
           300 ms of half-drawn imagery under a moving finger reads as lag. But 0 is the other extreme
           — it is a HARD SWAP, per tile. Zooming in, each child replaces its parent the instant it
           lands, so a screenful becomes a checkerboard of sharp and blurry squares flipping one at a
           time, and that flipping is the reported 点滅. `raster-fade-duration` is also what holds the
           parent while the child loads; at 0 there is nothing holding it.
           180 ms is under the ~200 ms at which a transition stops reading as a delay and still long
           enough for the eye to see one image become another instead of being replaced by it. The
           whole-Earth floor beneath (js/world-base.js) gets the same number, so the very first paint
           of a view fades from the floor rather than snapping off it — and #R190 already made the two
           the same colour, which is what makes a cross-fade between them read as one picture
           sharpening. Every OTHER raster overlay keeps 0: they are data layers, not photographs, and
           a half-faded thermal-anomaly value is a wrong value. */

     the map-container box changes EVERY frame, so the ResizeObserver → map.resize() reallocates the WebGL back-buffer ~25×
     during the ~0.4 s slide, each realloc a brief blank/stretched frame. Fix (the frosted-mode path already proves it):
     SUPPRESS the per-frame resize while a known sidebar slide is in flight and resize the buffer exactly ONCE at

         the first thing the user sees should be the finished map, not a bare basemap that grows
         Köppen and the cables a second later. So the default-layer dispatch is FORCED rather than
         waited for, and the screen lifts on the idle after it.
         Both stages carry their own escape: an idle can be delayed indefinitely by one slow tile
         host, and a launch screen that outlives the app it is covering is the worse failure. */
      /* ══ (#R190) THE LAUNCH SCREEN WAS WAITING IN SERIES, AND LIFTING BEFORE THE END ═══════════════
         「初期画面のローディングが遅い。また、ローディング画面終了後も読み込みが終わっていない。
           これでは初期画面の意味がない。」

         Both halves of that came out of the same shape. #R186's sequence was:
             wait for idle #1  →  fire the default layers  →  wait 380 ms  →  wait for idle #2
         The default layers were not ASKED FOR until the basemap had already gone quiet, so their
         download (a multi-megabyte climate raster and the cable network) started after the basemap's
         instead of alongside it — the two waits ran end to end when they could have overlapped. That
         is the 「遅い」. And the second wait had a 3-second escape, so on exactly the slow load the
         escape exists for, the screen lifted with those layers still arriving — 「終了後も読み込みが
         終わっていない」.

         Now the default layers are fired IMMEDIATELY at style-ready, so everything downloads at once,
         and the screen lifts only when the map is idle AND the layers it was told to wait for are
         actually on the map. The escapes are still there — a launch screen that outlives its app is
         the worse failure (#R186) — but they are now the failure path rather than the normal one:

       reading» was also the one that erased what was being read. MEASURED before this change
       (1280×800 and 375×812, local build of R441): open an Event detail → `window._imReader` carries
       title+body; open Atlas → `_imReader` is null and `IntMapConsole.state()` has no OPEN NEWS

       separate window and setMode() is never called.
       ⚠ `carryArticle` is NOT «keep it around a while». It is set by exactly one caller — setMode()
         ENTERING Atlas — and the very next tab gesture (including deselecting Atlas) clears it, so the
         subject lives precisely as long as the conversation the reader opened it for.
       ⚠ AND IT IS MARKED, NOT SILENTLY PRESERVED: `onScreen:false` is how js/atlas-state.js knows to
