/* ============================================================================
 *  IntMap · ATLAS — THE TURN LOOP: ATLAS DECIDES, INTMAP EXECUTES  (#R406)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  「AtlasをIntMap全体の主体的な知能・操作レイヤーへ戻すことである。」
 *
 *  WHAT THIS REPLACES. The old turn was one shot: a request profile derived from regular
 *  expressions decided whether the message was a question, whether the map was wanted and whether
 *  the subject was present or past; a capability selector turned that into a slice of a 61 kB
 *  catalogue; the model was forced to answer `{"say":string,"actions":[]}` — there was NO shape
 *  that meant "just answer" — and `say` was required to state what had been done at a moment when
 *  nothing had been done yet. Then `_validatePlan` rewrote the actions it disagreed with, and a
 *  repair pass asked again. Atlas never saw a single execution result before it had to commit.
 *
 *  ⚠ THE DEFECT THAT NAMED THIS ROUND IS ONE LINE OF THAT. `_requestProfile`'s `wantExpl` matched
 *  `[?？]` and a list of interrogatives, so 「セーヌ川の長さは？」 was a question and
 *  「セーヌ川の長さは・」 was not. Adding `・` to the character class is the fix this round is
 *  forbidden to make: the bug is not the punctuation, it is that a regular expression was deciding
 *  what a sentence meant. Nothing here asks that question at all.
 *
 *  THE SHAPE. Atlas is given the user's words, the conversation, a compact machine-readable
 *  snapshot of IntMap's state, and a set of TOOLS. Each step it chooses one of two things:
 *
 *      · a final answer — including on the very first step, with no tool call at all; or
 *      · one or more tool calls, whose MECHANICAL results come back to it.
 *
 *  It keeps choosing until it answers or the technical ceiling is reached. The final sentence is
 *  therefore always written by something that has already seen what happened.
 *
 *  ⚠ WHAT STAYS IN CODE IS EXACTLY WHAT A MODEL CANNOT BE TRUSTED TO DO TO ITSELF: does the tool
 *  exist, do the arguments type-check, are the required ones present, how many times may this loop
 *  go round. What LEAVES is every rule about meaning. A tool call that fails to type-check is not
 *  an error the reader is shown — it is a typed rejection handed straight back to Atlas, which
 *  fixes it. The reader sees one answer, once, at the end.
 *
 *  ⚠ NO DOM, NO NETWORK, NO GLOBALS. `model` and `execute` are injected, so tests/r406-agent.test.mjs
 *  drives THIS module — the one the browser runs — against a scripted model with no browser and no
 *  key. That is the js/atlas-answer-pipeline.js pattern and it is the reason the E2E matrix in this
 *  round is not a second architecture.
 * ==========================================================================*/

       Atlas runs may itself ask the model (analyze → js/atlas-answer-pipeline.js spends ONE; the
       repair that used to make it two is gone with the audit's power, #R472). Four leaves that room. Going to six here would mean the reader's
       LAST step — the sentence — is the one that 429s, which is the worst possible place to run
       out. `stopped:'transport'` below is the belt to this braces. */
    /* ⚠ (#R413) `maxSteps` WAS 4, AND IT WAS THE CLIENT BEING STRICTER THAN THE SERVER. The comment
       above is the reasoning that produced it, and it is the reasoning this round is told not to
       repeat: rather than raise the budget it was written against, it lowered Atlas's. Four steps
       INCLUDING the sentence means a turn may look, act, check and speak — and no more, so
       「現在地から大阪駅まで」 (locate → find the router → route → answer) fits with nothing left over,
       and any repair at all runs the turn out. The budget it was rationing is TURN_MAX_CALLS in
       supabase/functions/ai-proxy, which this round raises to 12 in the same commit. Atlas gets the
       room; the ceiling stays only as the runaway-loop backstop it was meant to be.
       「制限を増やす方向、例外を増やす方向に持っていくな」 — CONSTITUTION.md §5. */
    /* ══ ⚠⚠⚠ (#R452) …AND THE ONE CEILING THAT WAS MISSING WAS THE CLOCK ══════════════════════════
       Every ceiling above counts something. None of them measured TIME, and `out = await execute(call)`
       below had no deadline of any kind — so a turn's length was the sum of whatever the network felt
       like doing, with no upper bound at all. Measured on the live site: an evidence fetch walked
       three CORS relays at 9 s each with the clock cleared at the headers, `analyze` made half a
       dozen of those, the calls in one step are awaited one after another, and a step may carry
       eight of them. 8 × 8 × (a relay having a bad afternoon) is not a number — it is 「ずっと
       Searching」, which is what was reported.
       ⚠ THIS TAKES NOTHING FROM ATLAS (CONSTITUTION.md §5), and it is deliberately NOT a smaller
       world: no source is dropped, no tool is withheld, no count is lowered. They exist so that the
       ONE thing the reader is owed — an answer, even if the answer is 「これは取れなかった」 —
       always arrives. A turn that never ends tells them nothing at all.

       ⚠⚠⚠ AND THE NUMBERS ARE MEASURED, NOT PICKED. The first draft of this round wrote 45 s and
       180 s, on the assumption that a healthy turn takes about ten seconds. Then the live site was
       measured: ONE ordinary turn about an open news article took **191 s**, spending FOUR ai-proxy
       calls of 8.1 / 51.2 / 48.9 / 17.2 s — and the slowest single call seen was **73.2 s**. A tool
       call is worse still, because `analyze` spends one of those (two, before #R472 removed the
       repair) plus its 32 s evidence gather plus a 20 s pinning pass: roughly 200 s for ONE tool
       call that is working perfectly. Both first drafts would therefore
       have fired on turns that were about to succeed, replacing a good answer with a degraded one —
       which is precisely the 「制限を増やす方向」 this round was told not to take. The values below
       clear the measured worst case with room, and nothing else decides them. */

    /* ── THE WIRE SHAPE OF ONE STEP ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       Two fields, and either may be the whole reply. `final_text` alone ends the turn — the shape
       the old PLAN_SCHEMA had no way to express, which is why every ordinary question had to be
       dressed up as an `answer` action.
       ⚠ `arguments_json` IS A STRING ON PURPOSE. A tool's arguments differ per tool, so the field
       is a free-form object — and OpenAI's strict json_schema mode cannot express one: an object
       with no declared properties makes strictJsonSchema() return null, which drops the WHOLE
       schema to plain json_object mode and takes the enforcement of `name` down with it. Carrying
       the arguments as JSON text keeps every other field strictly checked, and is what native
       function calling does with them anyway. The caller accepts an object too, for a model that
       sends one regardless. */
    /* ══ ⚠⚠⚠ (#R511) `answer_mode` — THE MAP AS AN OUTPUT MODALITY, DECLARED BY ATLAS ═════════════
       #R406 removed «do not finish a location-rich answer having mapped nothing» because a place
       NAME is not a reason to draw (「フランス革命はなぜ起きたのか」 names Paris and wants prose), and
       left whether to use the map to Atlas. Correct — and it left the other half empty: a turn that
       DECIDED the map carried part of its answer could still end with the map untouched, and the
       loop had no way to notice, because `final_text` says nothing about the map. Measured on the
       ordinary shape 「Xを地理的に説明して」: the model writes the paragraph in its head, returns it on
       step 0, and IntMap counts that as a complete turn. It was.
       `answer_mode` is Atlas SAYING which kind of answer this is — "text" (the map is untouched),
       "map" (the map IS the answer; the words frame it), or "mixed" (both carry it). The loop does
       not decide it, suggest it, or infer it from words. What it does is hold Atlas to its OWN
       declaration, exactly as `reject()` holds a call to its own tool's schema: a "map"/"mixed" reply
       arriving before anything this turn changed the map is handed back as a typed note
       (`map_not_drawn`), and Atlas chooses again — draw now, or answer as "text" and say why. That
       is a consistency check between two things the model said, not a rule about meaning. */
    /* ══ ⚠⚠ (#R540) THE MAP WAS THE FIRST OUTPUT, NOT THE ONLY ONE ═══════════════════════════════
       "chart" joins the vocabulary, and the gate below stops being about maps. The wrong way to add
       it would have been a second flag and a second bounce beside the first — CONSTITUTION.md §5
       calls that accumulation by its result, 「互いに矛盾する門が増え、どれが効いたのか誰にも言えなく
       なる」. So there is ONE gate over a set: a declaration names the outputs that would satisfy it,
       and a final is held to whichever it named. "mixed" means "the words are not the whole answer"
       and is satisfied by EITHER — a widening, so nothing it accepted before is refused now. */

           `ask_user` was an ordinary tool: it rendered a picker into the reader's bubble, returned
           {ok:true}, and the loop went round again — so a turn could ask, ask a second time, and
           then go and do the work anyway. Measured on 「ここから大阪駅まで行きたい。」 (the reported
           transcript, reproduced in tests/r419-checks.test.mjs ①): two live question cards and a
           finished route, all in the same bubble, the questions already moot by the time they
           appeared. And because the card was live WHILE the turn was still running, answering one
           superseded that turn — three answers, three 「停止しました」, three turns thrown away.
           A question is a request for something the loop does not have. There is nothing to
           continue with until it comes back, so the turn ends here and the reader's reply opens the
           next one. ⚠ THIS TAKES NOTHING FROM ATLAS (CONSTITUTION.md §5): it does not decide
           whether to ask, when to ask, or what to ask — only that having asked, the turn is over.
           The flag lives on the TOOL, not on a name matched here, so the loop still knows nothing
           about what any particular tool means. */
