/* ── (#R186) THE DATA LAYERS THAT ARE ON BEFORE ANYONE TOUCHES ANYTHING ──────────────────────────
   「デフォルトでは、ケッペンと海底ケーブルレイヤーがオンが初期状態に。」
   Three readers need this list and they must not disagree, so it is stated once, here, above the
   factory that builds the rows:
     · the row builder below marks these checkboxes `checked`;
     · js/app-body.js dispatches their `change` once the style can accept layers — a checked box on
       its own paints nothing, which is the mistake #R34 already recorded for the Place-names toggle;
     · the session restore in js/app-body.js switches one back OFF when the saved snapshot says the
       user had switched it off, so "default on" never means "cannot be turned off".
   Ids, not layer keys, because that is what all three readers hold. */
window.IntMapDefaultLayers=['dl-climate','dl-subcables'];
/* ══ ⚠⚠ (#R225) THE BASE TOGGLES SHIP `checked` AND THE RESTORE NEVER TURNED THEM BACK OFF ══════════
   「base map & labelsも勝手に全部オンになる」 — and it was structural, not a glitch. index.html ships
   `cb-names / cb-geolabels / cb-poi / cb-borders / cb-admin1 / cb-roads / cb-rail2` CHECKED. The session
   snapshot records the boxes that are ticked, and js/session-tabs.js's restore turns ON everything in
   that list but only turns OFF the ids in `IntMapDefaultLayers` — which is Köppen and the cables.
   So a base toggle the reader switched off was saved correctly as «absent» and then, on the next load,
   was left at its HTML default: ON. Every reload undid the choice, for ever.
   ⚠ THE LIST HAS TO BE ONE LIST. #R186's rule is «absent means the user switched it off» and it has to
   hold for every DEFAULT-ON id, not for the two that happened to be thematic. `IntMapDefaultLayers`
   keeps its old meaning (the thematic layers the app switches on for a first-time reader, and the ones
   `imAutoOff` protects); `IntMapDefaultOn` is that set PLUS the base toggles the HTML ticks, and it is
   what the restore's off-sweep reads. Adding a default-on row means adding it here, once.
   ⚠⚠ (#R476) «HERE» IS TWO PLACES AND THEY ARE ONE EDIT. index.html has to ship the box `checked` as well,
   because this list is not what ticks it — js/app-body.js only dispatches `change` for boxes that are
   ALREADY ticked (#R34), and js/data-layers.js's IntMapBaseDisplay.matches() compares the live ticks
   against defOn(). Half the edit is silent both ways: the tick alone drops 基本表示 to 「カスタム」 400 ms
   after every boot, the id alone paints nothing. tests/r476-checks ① holds the two sides equal, in BOTH
   directions — the html→list direction had no gate at all until this round.
   ⚠ It reaches FIRST-TIME readers only. A saved session that predates the change has the id absent, and
   the restore's off-sweep below reads absence as «the reader switched it off» (#R186/#R225) and switches
   it back off. Healing those would be a `defv` generation bump (#R189/#R190); not done — the round was
   asked for the default, not for a migration. */

/* ══ ⚠⚠⚠ (#R309) WHAT "Base map & labels" CONTAINS, AS ONE LIST ═══════════════════════════════════
   「Base map & labelsのオン数をレイヤーのオン数にみなすな。」 The reason it was counted is that the
   membership of that section existed in FOUR hand-written copies and they disagreed. Measured against
   the section the panel actually drew (13 rows at the time; nine cb-* + two, since #R469):
       js/data-layers.js `skip` (the "Active layers (N)" counter)  11 ids — missing dl-tz, beta-dl-bldg3d
       js/data-layers.js reorganizeLayerPanel's ordering           10 ids + three appended rows
       js/data-layers.js the unplaced-rows sweep                   10 ids
       js/widget-core.js `activeLayers` (the "N layers on" card)   excluded the ten cb-* only BY ACCIDENT
                                                                   (they are bare labels, not .lyr-row),
                                                                   so it counted the other three
   #R235 already fixed this once for `dl-nightside` by adding an eleventh literal to one of the copies —
   #R271 and #R273 then moved `dl-tz` and `beta-dl-bldg3d` into the section and neither copy learned.
   `IntMapBasicLayerRows` is the checkbox rows in the order the panel shows them (ten then, NINE
   now — `cb-countries` went to `IntMapHiddenLayerRows` in #R469);
   `IntMapBasicLayers` is the whole section, and it is what any counter must subtract (thirteen then,
   ELEVEN now — `dl-tz` became an ordinary layer in the same round).
   ⚠ NOT the re-assert exclusion further down: that list answers a different question («which toggles
   have stateful handlers that a re-dispatched change would flip back on», #R38) and the three rows
   added here are ordinary async layers that DO want the re-assert. Same ids, different rule.
   ⚠ BOTH halves are on `window`, not module-level `const`s. This file is a module (#R175), so a
   top-level binding would be private to it and invisible to js/widget-core.js — and
   tests/r175-checks.test.mjs fails the whole shape on sight, which is how that was caught here. */
/* ⚠⚠ (#R469) TWO ROWS LEFT THIS LIST, IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS — see `IntMapHiddenLayerRows` below.
     · `cb-countries` 国境・国情報 — 「レイヤー行だけ隠す」. It is no longer a row anywhere, so it is no
       longer a member of the always-on block; and it is NOT subtracted from the counters either,
       because the 「表示中のレイヤー」 chip is now the only handle a reader has for switching it off
       when Atlas or the Countries window raised it. A layer with no row and no chip is a layer that
       cannot be turned off.
     · `dl-tz` 🕒 タイムゾーン — 「基本表示ではなく普通のレイヤーにして」. It is a row of `lyrGrpPolitics`
       now and is counted like any other layer. */

window.IntMapBasicLayers=window.IntMapBasicLayerRows.concat(['dl-nightside','beta-dl-bldg3d']);
/* ══ ⚠⚠⚠ (#R469) ROWS THAT KEEP THEIR CHECKBOX AND LOSE THEIR ROW ═════════════════════════════════
   A layer the panel never draws is not a layer that was deleted: the checkbox stays in the
   permanently-hidden `#layer-dropdown` registry, so its change handler, its legend, its opacity, its
   entry in the session snapshot and every door Atlas has to it keep working exactly as before. What
   goes is one thing — the row in the layer browser.
     · `cb-countries` 国境・国情報 — the reader asked for the row to go; Atlas's `countryInfo` action and
       `window._wsCountryInfo` (the Countries window's own toggle) still raise the overlay.
     · `dl-contours` 等高線 — 「等高線レイヤーは廃止し、…の凡例内でトグルでオンオフできるように統合」.
       This checkbox is where the state lives; the three elevation legends press it (`_contourSwitch`).
   ⚠ EVERY SWEEP THAT FILES ROWS MUST BE TOLD. `reorganizeLayerPanel`'s `order.push` MOVES an element,
   so a row nobody claims lands in Beta — measured in #R271, when 🕒 タイムゾーン came out there.
   `rowsFromDropdown` (js/map-ui.js) and `renderLayerFavs` (js/layer-favs.js) read this list too: a
   hidden row must not come back as a favourite star or a tile. */
window.IntMapHiddenLayerRows=['cb-countries','dl-contours'];
/* ══ ⚠⚠⚠ (#R469) 基本表示 IS THREE EXCLUSIVE CHOICES NOW, NOT A LIST OF ELEVEN SWITCHES ═════════════
   「もとは基本表示があった場所をデフォルト/クリーン/カスタムとして、カスタムを選択すれば今の基本表示の
     一覧が出てくるように。デフォルトは今の基本表示のデフォルトオンをそのままやればいい。クリーンは全基本
     表示をオフってこと。…複数選択ではないです。どれか一つ。」
   The eleven switches did not go anywhere — they are the 「カスタム」 list. What is new is that the
   section's own answer is one of three, and the first two SET the eleven rather than describing them.
   ⚠ THE MODE IS A CLAIM ABOUT THE STATE, so it cannot outlive it. Anything at all may flip a base
   toggle — Atlas, the wind layer's one-shot coastline offer (#R289), a restored session — and the
   moment one of them disagrees with the mode, the mode says 「カスタム」. That is `_reconcile` below,
   and it is why the reader can never be shown a section headed 「デフォルト」 over a map that is not.
   ⚠ THE DEFAULT SET IS DERIVED, NOT COPIED. #R309 spent a round undoing four hand-written copies of
   the membership of this section; a hand-written copy of its DEFAULTS would be the same defect one
   field over. `window.IntMapDefaultOn` is the list for the nine `cb-*`; the two rows that are not
   `cb-*` are stated here because they are not in it and never were (#R233 / #R273).
   ⚠ NOT A `const` — this file is a module (#R175), so a top-level binding would be invisible to
   js/map-ui.js, which is where the three rows are drawn. */

         so it reads as a qualification of the picture rather than more of the description.

         ⚠⚠ NO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE IN THIS COMMENT — this whole block is inside a JS template
         literal, and one backtick here ends the string and blanks the site (memory: #R? 「CSSに
         バッククォートを入れるな」). Names below are quoted with «» for that reason.
         「モデルの選択欄が凡例から突き出ている。」 MEASURED: «.ecl-modelpick» appears in exactly one
         place in this repository — the string that BUILDS it in js/weather.js. It was never styled,
         so the «select» inside it was a bare native control, and a bare native control sizes to
         its WIDEST OPTION. The options carry the model name plus, when a model cannot draw that
         layer, the reason («NOAA GFS 0.13° — この気圧面は未提供»), which is far wider than the
         178 px box (158 px of content) the legend actually is — so it hung out of the panel, over
         the map, on every weather legend. #R356 added the picker and the styling never followed.
         → the label goes ABOVE the control and the control takes the full content width.
         ⚠ «min-width:0» IS THE LOAD-BEARING LINE. A flex item's automatic minimum size is its
         MIN-CONTENT width, and for a «select» that is the widest option again — so «width:100%»
         alone does not stop it, and this is why an obvious-looking one-liner would not have fixed
         it. «box-sizing:border-box» keeps the border and padding inside the 100%.
         ⚠ THE NATIVE DROPDOWN ARROW IS KEPT (no «appearance:none»): it is the only affordance that
         says this is a control rather than a line of text, and #R290 is about controls a reader
         cannot reach. Sized from «.ecl-b», like every other control in this legend. */

         third time; confirmed: 各レイヤー個別に年セレクタを付ける.)

       #R268's audit answered this with three buckets and put six layers in the bucket 「既にマスター
       クロックで変えられる」 — 1人当たりGDP・合計特殊出生率・人口密度・平均寿命・国防費・HDI. That is
       true of the DATA and it was not true of the READER: nothing on those layers says a year can be
       changed at all, and the control that changes it is a button called 「過去の世界を見る」 on the
       other side of the screen. Meanwhile the World-Bank choropleths (#R266), the GIBS rasters
       (#R268), Köppen, land cover, night lights, annual precipitation and the US elections all carry
       a year picker in their own legend. Same question, two answers, depending on which layer you
       happened to open.

       ⚠ IT IS THE SAME CLOCK, NOT A SECOND ONE. The standing rule is one master clock
       (window.IntMapTime, #R94); a per-layer year that kept its own state would be exactly the
       「2つの時計」 #R265 and #R267 each had to remove. This row READS `IntMapTime` and WRITES
       `IntMapTime`, and it subscribes so that moving the time machine moves every one of these
       selectors with it. The hint under it says so, because a control that silently moves the whole
       app is worse than one that says it does.

         「パネル内のポップアップや凡例は×可能だがドラッグ可能にはしないように。」
         「タップしたらどんどん消えていく現象ふざけるな。」

         js/window-manager.js refuses the gesture for a docked panel, and that fix did NOT stop the
         legends — measured in the sidebar: a 100 px drag on the Köppen legend's header still moved
         it 378 px down and wrote `inset:378.25px auto auto 8px !important`, i.e. straight out of the
         column. Because a legend has never gone through `makeDraggable`: #R19 gave the legends their
         own delegated drag HERE, so that an `innerHTML` rebuild could not orphan the handle. Two
         implementations of one gesture, and the guard was added to one of them —
         [[intmap-recurring-lessons]] G, one level down from the defect it was fixing.

         ⚠ THE TEST IS THE CLASS, NOT A NEW GLOBAL. `im-docked` is what js/window-manager.js puts on
         every docked element and what the stylesheet already keys off, so this asks the same
         question the CSS asks and there is no third place that decides what «docked» means.
         ⚠ AND WHY IT LOOKED LIKE «消えていく»: `begin()` pins the legend to its on-screen spot with
         inline `!important` before releasing the anchors. In the column that spot is measured from
         the map container, hundreds of pixels away, so one touch that moved a few pixels teleported
         the legend out of view. It never closed. */

         離散的な感じに。データのない時間を選べないように。」

       The calendar these layers carried was one line of markup with `max="今日"` and NO `min` at all,
       and setGlobalLayerDate clamped every one of them to the SAME 今日−2. So a reader could ask
       IMERG for 1998, MODIS AOD for 2005, or MUR SST for a day it has not processed yet — and GIBS
       answers a day it does not have with fully transparent tiles. A layer that is ON and draws
       nothing is indistinguishable from a broken layer, which is the report.

       ⚠ THE THREE NUMBERS PER PRODUCT ARE MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. Read out of GIBS's own WMTS
       capabilities (…/wmts/epsg3857/best/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml, the Time dimension of each
       layer) on 2026-08-21:

         IMERG_Precipitation_Rate                2000-06-01 … 2026-08-20   P1D    6 ranges
         GHRSST_L4_MUR_Sea_Surface_Temperature   2002-06-01 … 2026-08-20   P1D   10 ranges
         MODIS_Terra_NDSI_Snow_Cover             2000-02-24 … 2026-08-21   P1D    8 ranges
         MODIS_Combined_Value_Added_AOD          2017-04-19 … 2026-08-20   P1D   13 ranges

       `lagDays` is (the day that was measured − the newest day the product had), i.e. the PIPELINE's
       delay, so it does not go stale the way a date would: 1 day for the three that publish
       overnight, 0 for MODIS Terra snow cover, which GIBS advertises for the current UTC day.
       All four measured P1D, so `cadence` is 'daily' for all four — none of these is an 8-day or a
       monthly composite. The other two cadence shapes are implemented because the domain document
       below expresses them (P8D → {everyDays,epoch}, P1M → 'monthly'), not because a layer here uses
       one today.

       ⚠ AND THE HOLES ARE NOT GUESSABLE, SO THEY ARE NOT GUESSED. Every one of these products is
       published as SEVERAL ranges with days missing between them (AOD has thirteen — 2018-09-20 …
       2018-09-29 is simply absent), and that list moves. GIBS publishes it as a ~600-byte CORS-open
       document per layer, so _ensureDateDomain() asks for it once, the first time a reader touches
       that layer's calendar. Until it answers — and if it never does — the declared triple is what
       the calendar uses. Right at boot, exact a moment later. */

           「レイヤーのカテゴリ分類があきらかに不適切なレイヤーが大量にある。大規模にレイヤーカテゴリ分類を
             再編しろ。」

           #R255, #R258, #R261 and #R270 all wrote the same ⚠ note into this file — 「再編 is not a
           licence to overturn a list the reader wrote out by hand」 — and each moved three or four
           rows. That reservation was right while the instruction said 「任せる」 about 「いくつか」.
           It is now 「大量にある」 and 「大規模に…再編しろ」, which is the licence those notes said they
           did not have, so the whole panel was read against its headings and TWENTY rows moved. Each
           one is named below with the reason, and the reason is always the same shape: the row's own
           subject names a category that exists on this panel and is not the one it was on.

           WHAT MOVED, and out of / into what:
             · 民主主義指数 `dem`, 汚職・腐敗指標 `cpi`   人口・経済 → 政治・統治
               Two governance indices on the population shelf while a Politics & governance shelf
               existed (#R255 created it and #R270 explicitly left these two behind, saying 「say the
               word and they move」). This is the word.
             · 平均寿命 `lifeexp`                        人口・経済 → 医療・衛生
               …where 平均寿命（世界銀行） `wblife` already was. Two life-expectancy rows, two shelves.
             · エネルギー構成 `energy`                    人口・経済 → エネルギー・資源
               #R254 filed it under 人口・経済 because there was no energy shelf; #R258 built one.
             · オーロラ予測 `aurora`                      災害・夜空 → 宇宙・軌道
               A space-weather forecast, beside the satellites it disturbs.
             · 夜間光 `nightsat`                          災害・夜空 → 人口・経済
               Night lights are the satellite view of where people live; they are not a hazard.
               (…and with those two gone the heading no longer says 「夜空」 — see the locale files.)
             · 人口増加率・65歳以上・合計特殊出生率（世界銀行）・都市人口・農村人口・人口密度（世界銀行）・
               難民受け入れ数  `wbpopgrow` `wbaging` `wbfert` `wburb` `wbrural` `wbdensity` `wbref`
                                                          社会・教育 → 人口・経済
               Seven demographic series were on the education shelf while the population shelf held
               eight rows. A reader looking for 人口 statistics looks under 人口.
             · 土地被覆・エコリージョン・植生指数・森林面積率
               `worldcover` `ecoregions` `gxndvi` `wbforest`   地形・標高 → 自然・土地被覆 (NEW)
               Land COVER is not elevation. Four rows about what grows on the ground were filed with
               the rows about the shape of it; they get their own shelf.
             · 3D建物（都市）`bldg3d`                     地形・標高 → テクノロジー・インフラ
               #R261 filed it under terrain with 「built ground is still ground」. A building is not
               ground; it is built infrastructure, which this panel has a shelf for.
             · タイムゾーン `tz`                          指標・オーバーレイ → the always-on switches
               「指標・オーバーレイ」 held exactly one row. A live-clock overlay of the whole planet is
               the same KIND of switch as the grid and the day/night shading (#R233's reasoning for
               `nightside`), so it joins them and the one-row shelf is empty (its KEY is kept).

           ⚠ WHAT DID NOT MOVE, and why: every row whose subject the heading above it actually names.
           #R254's sixty-one World-Bank rows keep their families and their internal order; the four
           shelves #R261 created keep their contents; nothing is deleted, and the safety sweep at the
           end of this function still catches anything unlisted. */

               · `wbforest` 森林面積率 : Climate → Terrain & land. It is a LAND-COVER share, and it
                 belongs beside `worldcover` and `ecoregions`, not beside CO₂ and rainfall.
               · `wbagri` 農地率 : Terrain → Agriculture. Its own twin `wbagremp`(農業就業率) was
                 already there and these two are the same subject counted two ways.
               · `gxsoil` 土壌水分 : Terrain → Agriculture. The layer's own note says what it is for
                 — 「干ばつ・農業の指標」 — and that sentence names the category.
               · `wbpm25` PM2.5大気汚染 : Health → Climate & atmosphere, where the other three air
                 -composition rasters (AOD, UV aerosol index, CO) already are. Air pollution was
                 split across two shelves by whether the number came from a satellite or a table. */

             The whole panel was read against its headings again (167 rows, 17 headings). Most of it

             can be stated rather than felt:

               · 殺人発生率 (`wbhomicide`) was in 「軍事・安全保障 / Defense & security」, whose other
                 seven rows are defence spending, NATO, armed-forces strength, a front line and
                 military installations. A homicide rate is a crime statistic about a society, and it
                 joins the social indicators.
               · 緊急対応拠点 —— 消防・警察・救急 (`osmemg`) was in 「医療・衛生 / Health & sanitation」.
                 An ambulance station belongs to that subject; a POLICE station and a FIRE station do
                 not. All three are what a place has for an emergency, so they sit with the hazards.
               · 合計特殊出生率 (`wbfert`) was in Health, one shelf away from the OTHER 合計特殊出生率
                 (`tfr`, in 人口・経済) and away from the World-Bank demographic family it belongs to
                 (人口増加率・65歳以上人口比率・都市/農村人口比率・人口密度), all of which are in
                 Society & education. It joins them, and its NAME now says which of the two it is.

             ⚠ NOTHING ELSE MOVED, and that is deliberate. #R233's seven in 人口・経済, #R254's
             sixty-one and #R261's four new shelves were each written out by a reader by hand, and
             「任せる」 for the obviously-wrong rows is not a licence to re-sort a list somebody chose.

             WHAT WAS WRONG, MEASURED off the shipped panel (167 rows, 16 headings):
               · «Others» was 33 rows and every one was a World-Bank indicator — inflation beside
                 literacy beside refugees beside renewable electricity. That is not a category, it is
                 the tail of one table. It is now four families: economic (14), social and
                 educational (14), energy (5), and CO₂ total, which joins its own per-capita twin in
                 Climate. Nothing is dropped and the order inside each family is #R254's.
               · «Beta» was 40 rows, six of which are finished world-packs layers with their own
                 panel, legend, time-machine wiring and published sources (trade flows, ocean
                 currents, tides, crops, industry web, weather warnings). They were never demoted by

       「以下のレイヤーは国境線が雑い…勝手に解像度の低い国境線に変えるな。いつもにすればいいだけ。
         これは今後の国境線を使用するものすべてに言える。」

       MEASURED on the shipped build with only 1人当たりGDP switched on: Japan's polygon in the
       `countries` SOURCE carried **65 vertices**, while `window.countryGeo` already held the 10 m
       outline at **6,952** — 107× more, sitting in `window._imCountryGeoPending` and never handed to
       the renderer. Switching Countries(info) on flushed it and the same border became the fine one,
       which is exactly the reader's 「いつもの」.

       WHY. js/countries-ui.js boots on Natural Earth 110 m so the Countries tab can list its rows
       without waiting on 4.3 MB, then parks the 10 m collection until something is about to DRAW it
       (#R195 — pushing 548,000 vertices at a hidden layer cost two CI runs). #R216 gave
       `_imFlushCountryGeo` a `force` flag and used it in js/world-packs.js. This gate — the one every
       `dl-*` choropleth in this file goes through — was never given it, so gdppc / tfr / hdi / dem /
       milSpend / milSpendGDP / pop all painted the 110 m stand-in for the whole session.

       ⚠ `setSourceData` CLEARS FEATURE STATE, and these layers ARE feature state. So the flush is
       asked for BEFORE the paint, and again while the upgrade is still in flight (it lands 4-15 s
       after boot, later on a phone) — and when a late one succeeds, every visible choropleth is
       repainted through `_imReapplyChoros`. One poller for the whole module, not one per layer. */

       NATO and the EU each paint every member ONE colour, which answers 「who is in」 and says
       nothing about 「since when」 — although both layers have carried the real accession year
       since #R14/#R26 and both already have a year slider driven by it. A second colouring makes
       that year visible instead of only filterable, and the switch is in the legend beside the
       slider that uses the same numbers.
       ⚠ ONE PALETTE FOR BOTH.
       ⚠ AND THE BAR GOES AWAY WITH IT. #R270's defect was a legend whose gradient contradicted
       the colours on the map; a flat blue bar over a year-coloured map is the same statement. So
       the mode hides `.dl-bar`/`.dl-scale` and shows a chip per wave instead. */
    /* ══ ⚠⚠⚠ (#R290) 「加盟年別の色分けの色味が分かりにくい」 — AND THAT IS MEASURABLE ═══════════
       #R289 chose viridis for this on the argument that 「a rainbow would imply an order the eye
       has to be taught」. The reader has now looked at the result and cannot read it, so the
       trade-off is settled by the other criterion: how far apart two waves actually LOOK.
       MEASURED, CIEDE2000 between the closest pair in the set (which for a monotone ramp is
       always an adjacent pair — the one a reader has to tell apart on the legend):

           waves   viridis (before)   this palette (after)
             8         ΔE00 12.2            ΔE00 19.7      ← the EU
            11         ΔE00  8.1            ΔE00 19.7      ← NATO
            14         ΔE00  6.1            ΔE00 13.0

       ΔE00 ≈ 2.3 is the just-noticeable difference for large flat areas; 8.1 across eleven country
       fills at 55 % opacity over a basemap is not enough, and it is why 「分かりにくい」 is a fact
       about the palette rather than about the reader. The new set sweeps hue a full turn instead
       of a third of one, so the separation stops shrinking as waves are added — at eleven it is
       the same 19.7 as at eight. Order is still read off the sequence and off the legend chips,
       which name the year beside every swatch.
       ⚠ AND IT IS INDEXED, NOT INTERPOLATED. Sampling eleven colours out of a ten-anchor gradient
       is what put the closest pair at 8.1 in the first place; when there are no more waves than
       entries, each wave takes an ENTRY, so the measured separation is the separation on screen.
       (More entries than that — no such layer today — falls back to interpolation.) */
    /* ══ ⚠⚠ (#R293) 「ランダムな色の分け方ではなく、古いのから新しいのまで、赤から紫に連続的に」 ═══
       #R290 maximised how far apart the waves LOOK and got 26.1 (CIE76) by sweeping hue a full turn
       — which starts at dark blue, ends at lavender, and passes red in the middle. That is far apart
       and it is not an ORDER anybody can read off the map, which is what 「ランダム」 names.
       This ramp is the one the reader asked for: hue sweeps MONOTONICALLY from red (oldest) through
       orange, yellow, green and blue to purple (newest), so where a country sits in the sequence is
       legible without the key.
       ⚠ THE SEPARATION IS NOW A CONSEQUENCE, NOT THE OBJECTIVE, AND IT IS SMALLER — MEASURED:
       closest pair 23.9 (CIE76) against #R290's 26.1, and the closest pair is always an ADJACENT
       one, which is the signature of a continuous ramp: two waves that could be confused are
       neighbours in time, and no two distant waves ever are. It is still an order of magnitude
       above the 2.3 JND and roughly twice the 12.8 of the viridis sampling both of these replace.
       `tests/r293` asserts the monotone red→purple sweep AND re-computes the separation. */

       「モバイル版が、非常に重くなっている…わたしのguessは…iPhoneのメモリを占有して」— measured, and this
       is one of the two places the phone's memory was going. A phone loads the 4k Köppen file
       (koppenWorkURL), and the decoded bitmap of a 4096² PNG is 4096·4096·4 = 67 MB. It was then
       held FOREVER in window._koppenImg, on top of the ≤2048² work canvas built from it (17 MB) and
       the renderer's own texture for the same file (another 67 MB).

       Its only reader is ensureKoppenFull(), and on a phone _koppenFullCap() is 2048 — the SAME cap
       the work canvas is already built at. So the extra pixels are unreachable by construction, and
       dropping them is not a quality decision: the class highlight is rasterised from exactly the
       resolution it would have used. Where the cap IS higher than the work canvas (desktop: 3072 or
       4096) the image is kept, unchanged.

       ⚠ `im.src=''` as well as the reference: an <img> that is not in the document still owns its
       decoded bitmap for as long as anything points at it, and dropping the last reference only
       makes it collectable — which on a phone under pressure is later than "now". */

       「モバイル版がまだ劇的に遅い…ブラウザが落ちることもある。」 (iPhone / iOS Safari, confirmed.)

       MEASURED: koppen_mercator_1991-2020_4k.png is 4096 × 4096, i.e. 737 kB on the wire and
       **64 MB as a decoded bitmap** — and the Köppen layer is ON BY DEFAULT (IntMapDefaultLayers).
       `_mkKoppenWork` then draws that bitmap into a 2048² canvas and, on a phone, throws it away
       again (#R217). So the phone allocated 64 MB, used 17, and released it — a peak spike of 64 MB
       on a device whose whole tab budget is a few hundred, happening while MapLibre is uploading its
       own texture for the SAME file. That is a plausible tab kill, and it is entirely avoidable.

       `createImageBitmap(blob, { resizeWidth, resizeHeight })` decodes STRAIGHT to the target size:
       the 64 MB intermediate never exists. ⚠ `resizeQuality:'pixelated'` is not a preference here, it
       is the correctness condition — the whole point of the work canvas is that KCOL's exact palette
       survives so a pixel can be classified, and any smoothing invents colours between classes. That
       is the same reason `_mkKoppenWork` sets `imageSmoothingEnabled=false`.
       ⚠ FALLS BACK TO THE <img> PATH on anything that cannot do it (no createImageBitmap, no resize

       The canvas pipeline above re-encodes the whole image to highlight a class, which forced a
       resolution cap (the 8192² output canvas alone is ~268 MB → mobile OOM). Instead: the Köppen
       palette is CATEGORICAL, so `raster-color` (MapLibre ≥4.6 — we ship v5) can re-color each class

       the rest collapse to faded gray. raster-color-mix maps each palette RGB to a unique scalar
       (weights [2.7,0.6,0.1] separate all 30 classes by ≥1.1% of the 0–3.3 range — safe even in fp16),
       and a `step` ramp assigns the output color per class. No second decode, no canvas, no PNG encode →
       the displayed quality is the full 8192² everywhere AND the crash vector is gone ("画質は保持しろ、
       ただしモバイルでも落とすな" — both at once). raster-resampling:nearest while highlighted keeps

    /* ══ ⚠⚠ (#R372) THE ONE DEFAULT-ON LAYER WITHOUT A LADDER — AND IT WAS THE UNCAUGHT THROW ═══════
       MEASURED on the deployed site with the renderer's own addSource wrapped so the refusals could be
       read by NAME: two uncaught exceptions per boot, both «Style is not done loading.», both
       addSource('src-climate'), at t=1,690 ms and t=4,933 ms. src-subcables threw FIFTY-THREE times in
       the same load and reached nobody, because #R187/#R355 gave that layer the ladder inside
       addSubcables() and this one never got one: js/app-body.js dispatches the default-on `change`
       events on a timer (300/600/1600/2600 ms) instead of waiting for `load`, toggleLayer('climate')
       called addKoppen() bare — no whenStyleReady(), no try — and the throw left the change LISTENER,
       where app-body's own try{} around dispatchEvent cannot see it: a listener's exception is reported
       to the global handler rather than propagated back to the dispatcher. The second one is the
       self-heal at the foot of this file re-arming the box it found ticked-but-blank, which throws
       exactly the same way.
       ⚠ THE CURE IS NOT A try{}. Swallowing the refusal makes 「チェックが入っているのに描かれない」 the
       PERMANENT state — the blank pretending to be calm that CONSTITUTION §2.1.3 forbids. This is
       addSubcables()'s ladder applied where the exception actually is: build; if the style refused,
       wait and build again; woken by the renderer's own `styledata`, so a style that becomes usable at
       40 s paints at 40 s instead of waiting out the next tick; abandoned the moment the reader unticks
       the box; a no-op once the raster is on the map.
       ⚠ AND THE HORIZON DOES NOT RUN WHILE THE DOCUMENT IS HIDDEN — that is this round's finding, not a
       nicety. REPRODUCED 5/5 with a control: with requestAnimationFrame firing normally the boot ends
       with 0 exceptions and 63 layers; with rAF never firing — a background tab, a hidden pane — it
       ends with 2 exceptions and 0 layers, because MapLibre reaches its own _load() through
       frameAsync(), so a document that is never composited never finishes parsing its style. A
       stopwatch would spend the whole horizon while the renderer was not running at all, and give up
       before the reader ever looked at the tab.
       ⚠ Giving up leaves the box TICKED, deliberately, and that is where this differs from the cables:
       nothing here is unavailable (the era PNG is our own file) — only the style is missing, which is a
       whole-map condition. `dl-climate` is in the reconciler's STATIC table at the foot of this file,
       so a ticked-but-blank Köppen is re-armed there every few seconds; unticking it would silence the
       one mechanism still able to fix it. */

       aircraft layer wholesale and carried the RECORDING across — src/aviation-worker.js has kept a
       per-aircraft ring buffer of received fixes ever since — but not the other end. The drawing
       (drawTrack / TRACK_LINE / TRACK_3D), the card's Show/Hide row (_trackCard) and Atlas's
       layers.aircraftTrack all read `planeTracks`, which the OLD sweep filled and which has been
       empty since the day the old sweep stopped running. Selecting an aeroplane therefore drew a
       track of zero points and hid both layers — silently, because an empty track and "no track
       yet" look identical.
       ⚠ NOTHING IS RE-IMPLEMENTED HERE. The 2-D line, the altitude-following 3-D extrusion, the
       per-leg ground clamp (#R174), trackStats, the card row and the Atlas verb are all still the
       code that shipped; what was missing was four lines that put the worker's fixes into the array
       they already read. Rebuilding the drawing beside the existing drawing is how a product ends
       up with two of everything (§22.1).
       ⚠ METRES, NOT FEET. planeTracks stores altitude in metres AMSL — drawTrack subtracts the
       ground under each leg from it — and the worker's wire carries altFt. A track that skipped
       this conversion would be drawn 3.3× too high and would look like a working feature. */

       「Live aircraft trafficの最大航空機表示領域/数をもっと増やして。」

       The ceiling was never the renderer and never the aircraft count — it was ONE query. The feed's
       point endpoint takes a centre and a radius, and 250 nm is a HARD cap: measured against the live
       API, r=250 answers 200 and r=300/500/1000 all answer **403**, so a bigger circle is not on
       offer. #R? therefore refused to draw below z5, because one 463-km circle inside a
       continent-wide viewport is a blob in the middle rather than "the aircraft on screen".

       A circle is not the only shape available, though — several of them are. The viewport is now
       TILED with 250-nm circles on the step that makes their inscribed squares meet, the results are
       merged and de-duplicated on the ICAO 24-bit address, and the covered area grows with the
       number of circles instead of being fixed by one radius. Measured on the live API: eight
       sequential queries over Europe returned 200 every time, took 3.4 s in total, and yielded 1,956
       distinct aircraft where a single circle at the same centre returned 611.

       ⚠ AND THE PACE IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. The first version fired four at a time and 9 of 20
       came back as network failures — not 429s, bare "Failed to fetch", i.e. the host stopped
       answering this address at all — after which even single retries failed. Probed properly: the
       block lifts after 30 s of quiet, and 14 consecutive requests spaced 1.2 s apart then ALL
       succeed. So the sweep is STRICTLY SEQUENTIAL at 1.2 s, the budget is 16 circles rather than
       30, and the poll interval grows with the sweep (16 circles → one refresh a minute). That is
       0.29 requests a second in the long run — a fraction of what the feed tolerates — while a
       close-in single-circle view still refreshes every 20 s exactly as it always did. The
       staleness a wide sweep buys is invisible: a minute of flight is 15 km, five pixels at z4. */
    /* ══ (#R187) WIDER STILL ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
       「Live aircraft trafficの最大航空機表示領域/数をもっと増やして。」— re-reported after #R186.

       Re-measured against the live API first, because the ceiling has to be the feed's and not a
       guess: r=250 answers 200 (570 KB), r=300 and r=500 both answer 403, and there is no bounding-box
       or all-aircraft endpoint (/v2/all is 404). So 250 nm per query still stands and the only way to
       cover more sky is still more circles.

       The budget is therefore raised from 16 to 48 (mobile 6 → 12). One circle's inscribed square is
       615 km on a side, so the covered block grows from 4 × 4 = 2,460 × 2,460 km to 8 × 6 = 4,920 ×
       3,690 km — a continent rather than a country group.

       ⚠ THE PACE IS NOT RAISED WITH IT. #R186 measured where this feed cuts an address off: four
       concurrent requests killed 9 of 20 outright, while 1.2 s spacing sustained 14 in a row. That
       spacing is unchanged, which makes a full sweep ~58 s to issue, and the poll interval keeps its
       3.5 s-per-circle rule so the long-run rate stays where #R186 left it (48 circles → one refresh
       every 168 s ≈ 0.29 requests a second). The ceiling on that interval is raised to 180 s from 120
       purely so the rule is not silently clipped — a clipped interval would mean asking FASTER than
       the measured budget, which is the one thing that gets the address blocked. A close-in view is a
       single circle and still refreshes every 20 s exactly as before. */

       stretches). Longitude steps are widened by 1/cos(lat) so the ground spacing stays constant as
       the grid climbs away from the equator. When the view needs more circles than the budget, the

    /* ══ (#R188) THE SAME REQUESTS, HALF AS MANY OF THEM PER MILLION SQUARE KILOMETRES ═════════════
       「Live aircraft trafficの最大航空機表示領域/数をもっと増やして。」— reported a third time.

       Everything that could have made this easy was measured away first, and none of it survived:

         · A SECOND FEED. adsb.fi and adsb.lol both answer the same shape of query, and adsb.fi
           returns the same aircraft as airplanes.live (554 vs 554 over Frankfurt, union 561), so a
           second host would have been a second rate-limit bucket and twice the circles per minute.
           Measured from the page's own origin, BOTH answer `TypeError: Failed to fetch`: neither
           sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, so neither can be reached from a browser at all.
           airplanes.live remains the only key-less CORS-enabled ADS-B feed there is.
         · A FASTER PACE. #R186's 1.2 s came from a measurement, and it still holds: 34 consecutive
           circles at 1,200 ms all answered 200, while the same 34 at 700 ms gave 12 successes and
           then SIXTEEN consecutive hard failures — the address cut off, exactly the state #R186
           described. The gap is not negotiable and is unchanged.
         · A BIGGER CIRCLE. r=250 answers, r=300 and r=500 are 403. Unchanged since #R187.

       What was left is the one thing nobody had looked at: the LATTICE. Stepping by a circle's
       inscribed square throws away everything outside that square — a circle of radius r covers
       πr², the square keeps 2r², i.e. 64% of what each request already paid for. The optimal
       covering of a plane by equal circles is the TRIANGULAR lattice (Kershner 1939): neighbours at
       d = r√3, rows at d·√3/2, alternate rows offset by d/2, and every point of the plane inside
       some circle. Each request then owns a hexagon of (√3/2)d² = 2.598 r² instead of 2 r².

       Measured on this app's own numbers (r = 463 km, keeping a 4% overlap margin for the
       projection): 770 km between centres and 667 km between rows, so ONE REQUEST NOW COVERS
       513,600 km² where it used to cover 378,700 — 1.36× the sky for exactly the same 1.2 s.

       The circle budget then goes 48 → 128 (mobile 12 → 24). Combined: 18.2 → 65.7 million km², or
       3.6× the area of #R187, and the long-run request rate is IDENTICAL because the poll interval
       has always been 3.5 s per circle — a bigger sweep refreshes less often, it does not ask
       faster. The two costs a 128-circle sweep would have had are both paid off below: it takes
       154 s to issue (so the layer publishes AS IT GOES rather than at the end), and it used to
       lock out the next viewport for its whole duration (so a sweep the camera has left behind is
       now abandoned — which is only safe because what it had already published survives). */

         A 128-circle sweep takes 154 s to issue. Publishing only at the end would mean two and a half
         minutes of the previous answer and then everything at once, which is not what a bigger budget
         was asked for. So every few seconds the layer is rebuilt from:
           · every aircraft this sweep has seen so far, and
           · every aircraft the LAST published answer held that this sweep has not re-seen AND whose
             position is in a cell the sweep has not yet re-asked about.
         The second rule is what makes this exact rather than merely optimistic: an aircraft is only
         dropped once the feed has been asked about the patch of sky it was in and did not mention it.
         Age is a backstop for aircraft outside the current lattice entirely. */

       「船舶レイヤーは、APIキーが必要ですと出てくるので、没にしてましたが、ちゃんと実装したい。」
       It did say that, and that was the whole design: BYOK. Every reader had to go and get an
       aisstream.io credential, and until they did the layer drew NOTHING and toasted a prompt —
       upstream load proportional to USERS, and a feature only credential-holders could see. That is
       the structure #R341 removed for aircraft, and supabase/functions/ais-feed is the ship half of
       the same answer: one key held on the server, one shared snapshot, every reader served from it,
       and Digitraffic (keyless, CC BY 4.0) underneath so the layer is never empty and never asks.

       ⚠ THE BYOK PATH IS NOT REMOVED (AGENTS.md §3.1). A reader who HAS a key still streams
       aisstream.io directly from their browser — a live WebSocket is fresher than any snapshot can
       be, and their key is still theirs and still stored only in their browser. What changed is
       only what happens when there is NO key: real ships instead of a prompt.
       ⚠ …AND THE ZOOM FLOOR IS THE STREAM'S, NOT THE LAYER'S. The floor exists because the direct
       stream subscribes to the VIEWPORT and a whole-world subscription would be a firehose into one
       browser. The relay already holds the world, so there is nothing for a floor to protect.
       ⚠ BUT THE WHOLE WORLD IS NOT WHAT A BROWSER LOOKING AT ONE STRAIT SHOULD DOWNLOAD. Measured
       on the wire: ~65 gzipped bytes per vessel, so a Baltic-only set is 52 kB and a global one
       is megabytes — every 30 s, on a phone. The relay therefore has a VIEW channel (`?bbox=`) and
       this side asks for the viewport plus a margin, re-asking only when the view LEAVES the box
       it last fetched (a small pan inside the margin costs nothing). Below zoom 2 the view is the
       world and the world is what is asked for, same bytes at every zoom from there down. */

    /* ===== (#R172) AIRCRAFT AT THEIR REAL ALTITUDE ==========================================
       「Live aircraft trafficは、飛行中の高度に応じて、実際にIntMapの空間でもその高度に描画して。」
       The glyphs were a `symbol` layer, which MapLibre pins to the map SURFACE — a jet at 11 km and one
       taxiing sat at exactly the same height, and tilting the map showed no difference at all.
       MapLibre 5.24 has NO way to lift a symbol: `symbol-z-offset` / `symbol-elevation-reference` are
       absent from this build (checked in the dist — the properties simply do not exist), so the only
       primitive that takes a real altitude is `fill-extrusion`. Each aircraft therefore becomes a small
       aeroplane-shaped POLYGON built in ground metres, turned to its ADS-B track and extruded at its
       reported altitude, plus a hairline post down to its ground position so the height is readable and
       the aircraft stays tied to the point it is over.
       Honest about the one exaggeration: a real 60 m airframe is far under a pixel at these zooms, so the
       glyph has a MINIMUM on-screen size (it never shrinks below ~13 px) — the POSITION is real data, the
       silhouette's size is a symbol, exactly as the flat glyph always was.
       Altitude reference: the same trap the 3-D volume tool documents — with 3-D terrain on, the
       renderer's metres are above the GROUND, otherwise above SEA LEVEL. Airborne aircraft get the ground
       under the map centre subtracted so their altitude means AMSL either way; aircraft ON the ground are
       left at 0 so they sit on the terrain instead of hovering over it. */
    /* ══ (#R190) DEFAULT ON — AND A THIRD KEY GENERATION, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT A DEFAULT CHANGE COSTS ══
       「（あと、at real altitudeはデフォルトで選択状態に。）」

       #R187 made this default OFF so its restored 2-D glyph would be the thing on screen; #R189 had to
       bump the key because the #R172–#R186 era's TRUE was still sitting in storage. Now the default is
       TRUE again — and the mark no longer depends on the toggle at all, because #R190 draws the SAME
       original silhouette in both renderings (see _PLANE_OUTLINE). The two halves of the instruction
       stop fighting each other.

       ⚠ The generation is bumped a second time for the same measured reason it was bumped the first.
       `intmap_planes3d2` was written only by the checkbox — but it was written under a regime whose
       default was OFF, so a '0' in it is very often the era's default arriving by way of a check and
       an uncheck, not a standing preference for the flat glyph. Reading it here would hand exactly
       the reported bug back to anyone who had ever touched the toggle. Both legacy keys are removed;

       y=272 and its ground point at y=388, the only row on the whole screen that reported the feature was
       388 — at z9.5, z11.5 and z13.5 alike. So the lifted aircraft could not be hovered or clicked where
       it is drawn; only the patch of ground it happened to be over could.
       The pick is therefore done here, against the aircraft's real position: the engine projects
       (lng, lat, altitude) through the renderer's own model matrices (coords.projectAltitude), and the
       nearest aircraft within a finger-sized radius wins. The ground footprint keeps working too — the

       An extrusion has no stroke, so it is drawn as its own polygon (see refreshPlanes3D:
       `part:'rim'`) — (#R192) a RING, outer boundary _PLANE_RIM and inner boundary _PLANE_CORE, which
       is exactly the annulus `ctx.stroke()` paints and shares no surface with the body.
       ⚠ MITRED, NOT SCALED. #R185's rim was the whole plan-form grown about its centre, which puts
       more outset at the nose and the wingtips than beside the fuselage — a scaled copy, not a
       stroke. This offsets each vertex along the mitre of its two edge normals, so the band is
       `_PLANE_STROKE` units wide everywhere, exactly as the canvas stroke is. The mitre is limited at
       3.25× that so the 2.2-unit-wide fuselage notches cannot spike. */

    /* ══ (#R191) A `fill-extrusion` NEVER RENDERS THE COLOUR IT IS GIVEN ═══════════════════════════
       MapLibre lights every extrusion in the vertex shader — read it in fill_extrusion.vertex.glsl:

           color += vec4(0.03);                              // a fixed ambient, on every channel
           directional = clamp(dot(normal/16384.0, u_lightpos), 0, 1);
           directional = mix(1-I, max(1-luminance+I, 1), directional);
           v_color.rgb = clamp(color.rgb * directional * u_lightcolor, …, 1.0);

       so the mark's declared `#1e90ff` reached the screen as rgb(35,141,245) while the flat glyph —
       an icon, which is not lit — reached it as rgb(30,144,255). That is the reported colour change,
       and it is not something the aircraft layer chose.

       Two exits were measured and rejected. There is no per-layer escape in 5.24: the paint
       properties are opacity/color/pattern/translate/height/base/vertical-gradient — no
       emissive-strength. And `light.intensity = 0` DOES make every extrusion render its exact colour
       in every projection (measured: rgb(38,152,255) at z8 globe, z13 Mercator and at 62° of pitch,
       all identical) — but the light is a STYLE property, and with it flat the 3-D buildings lose
       their form completely: walls and roofs become one tone (screenshotted over Midtown).

       What is left is to ask for the colour that comes out right, which needs `directional`. It is
       not a free variable: measured with a white body, it is 0.933 under the globe projection —
       stable across z4→z10, off-centre views, 55° of pitch and 90° of bearing — and 1.0 under
       Mercator, which the app switches to at z12. So the compensation is a two-stop zoom ramp
       matching the renderer's own transition band, and it is exact except where a channel is already
       at the ceiling: blue 255 needs 1.075 of a channel under the globe, so it stays at 245 there.
       Measured result — globe rgb(30,144,245), Mercator rgb(30,144,255) against the glyph's
       rgb(30,144,255): two channels exact instead of none, and the third as close as the renderer
       can be asked to go. tests/r191 pins the constants against live pixels. */

         「Live aircraft trafficの飛行機のマークはat real altitude中もそうでないときと同じデザインに。」
         — reported for the fourth round. #R187 restored the glyph, #R190 gave the lifted body the same
         silhouette, #R191 matched the colour and put the white stroke back. What none of them checked
         is HOW BIG the two marks are, and they were never the same size:

             half-length on screen      z5      z9      z12     z15     z17
             flat glyph (icon-size)   11.0px  14.8px  14.8px  14.8px  14.8px
             lifted (#R190 sizes)     13.0px  13.0px  13.0px  40.0px  160px

         Measured on a live aircraft over Frankfurt at z15: the lifted mark's bounding box is 41 × 82
         px against the glyph's 19 × 26. The cause is the metre FLOOR — `max(60, 13·mpp)` reads as a
         minimum size but 13·mpp IS 13 px at every zoom, so the floor only ever binds deep in, where it
         pins the mark to a 120 m aeroplane and it grows without limit. That is a different mark.

         So the size is taken from the glyph's OWN ramp — the interpolation in the symbol layer below,
         evaluated at the same zoom — and the floor is gone with it. The two renderings are now the
         same picture at every zoom; only the parallax of the altitude separates them, which is the
         whole point of the mode.

         AND IT IS NOT A BLOCK. #R190 gave the extrusion 2.2 px of thickness so it would "not be a
         zero-height sheet"; that thickness is what a tilted camera sees as lit side walls, i.e. a
         solid object where the flat rendering has a flat mark. It is now sub-pixel (0.35 px), which is

    /* ══ (#R187) BACK TO THE FIRST DESIGN ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
       「航空機のマークは最初のデザインに戻して。」

       #R183 answered 「飛行機アイコンはもっと目立つものに」 by replacing this glyph — a real airliner
       plan-form, a white rim, a drop shadow, a larger size ramp — and #R185 carried the same treatment
       into the lifted 3-D body. The verdict on all of it is in: the FIRST design is the wanted one.

       `_PLANE_ORIG` (declared far above, next to _PLANE_OUTLINE — see the TDZ warning there) is the
       outline this app shipped with, taken verbatim from the original implementation (identical from
       the first commit through #R164, replaced in #R183). So are the canvas size (44), the colours,
       the 1.6-px white stroke, and the size ramp restored at the layer. There is no shadow, no rim,
       no halo: a flat fill and a thin white line, which is what was asked for.
       (#R190) …and the LIFTED body draws the same outline now, so the mark no longer depends on the
       toggle: 「at real altitude中も昔のもの」. `planes3D` is default ON again for that reason —
       #R187's OFF existed only because the two renderings disagreed.

       ⚠ The ONE thing not reverted is the raster resolution. #R183 found `addImage` being handed a
       44-px bitmap with no `pixelRatio`, so MapLibre treated 44 canvas pixels as 44 CSS pixels and the
       GPU upscaled it on every HiDPI screen. That is a defect, not a design: drawing the same 44-unit
       artwork at devicePixelRatio and declaring it produces the SAME on-screen size, just not blurred.
       Reverting it would restore a bug rather than an appearance. */
    /* ══ ⚠ (#R246) THE TWO AIRCRAFT COLOURS AND THE OUTLINE, EACH WRITTEN ONCE ═══════════════════
       「Live aircraft trafficで航空機の色は以下に。民間機：シアン #00D9FF 軍用機：鮮赤 #FF3040
         両方とも：より太いアウトライン」
       Both constants are read by the flat glyph AND by the two fill-extrusion cases below, so the
       2-D mark and the 3-D body cannot disagree (they did in #R173, which is why _feHex exists).
       ⚠ The military red is deliberately NOT the app's --info-mil #ff3b30 any more: beside cyan the
       warmer, more saturated #FF3040 is what separates the two at a glance, which is the point of
       having two colours at all. ⚠ And the outline is a CONSTANT rather than a number typed into
       the one place that strokes: 1.6 → 2.6 units of the 44-unit artwork, drawn at devicePixelRatio
       like the rest of the glyph (see the note above), so it thickens on every screen equally. */

       「デフォルトでは、ケッペンと海底ケーブルレイヤーがオンが初期状態に。（追記：片方しかつかない）」

       #R187 found a real defect (a refused addSource that was logged and abandoned) and fixed it. The
       report came back, so the asymmetry between the two default layers was measured from the page's
       own origin instead of reasoned about:

           fetch('https://www.submarinecablemap.com/api/v3/cable/cable-geo.json')
               → TypeError: Failed to fetch          (no Access-Control-Allow-Origin, EVERY time)

       So the direct request in the proxy list below has never once succeeded from a browser: the
       submarine cables have ALWAYS come through a free public CORS proxy, and the layer is up only
       when one of three volunteer proxies happens to be up. Köppen has no such dependency — it is a
       bundled PNG on the app's own origin — which is exactly why 「片方しかつかない」 names this one
       every time and never that one.

       Two changes, and neither invents a data source:

       1. THE ANSWER IS KEPT. A successful download goes into the Cache API and is served from there
          on the next visit BEFORE the network is tried, with a refresh behind it that updates the
          source in place when it lands. Same data, same attribution; a proxy outage now costs a
          refresh rather than the layer. (#R186's rule: a fallback that only appears after the
          network has timed out is not a fallback, it is a delay.)
       2. A FAILED DOWNLOAD IS NOT A PREFERENCE. When everything failed, the old code unticked the
          box — and _snapshot() saves the ticked boxes, so the next thing the user toggled wrote a
          session in which this layer was OFF. From then on the restore switched it off deliberately,
          for ever: one bad afternoon for corsproxy.io became a permanent 「片方しかつかない」.
          The box is now marked `imAutoOff` when the app is the one unticking it, the session keeps
          wanting it (js/app-body.js), and it is retried with backoff before giving up at all. */

    /* ══ (#R190) THE LAYER STOPS DEPENDING ON A STRANGER'S UPTIME ══════════════════════════════════
       「デフォルトでは、ケッペンと海底ケーブルレイヤーがオンが初期状態に。（追記：片方しかつかない）」

       #R188 measured why it is always THIS layer: submarinecablemap.com sends no ACAO, so the direct
       request has never once succeeded from a browser, and the layer was up only when one of three
       VOLUNTEER proxies happened to be alive. #R188 kept the answer (Cache API) and #R189 stopped a
       failure being recorded as a preference — both real, both about the SECOND visit. The first
       visit still asked a stranger.

       So the app now relays it through its own Edge Function, exactly as #R145 did for the
       Street-View coverage tiles: supabase/functions/cable-geo, an allowlist of these two URLs and
       nothing else, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, one day of edge cache. Same data, same source,
       same attribution — a request to our origin instead of to someone else's goodwill.

       ⚠ the bare URL stays FIRST even though it is measured to fail from a browser: the app is also
       opened from origins that are allowed to read it (a local file server, an extension host), and
       the data should not travel through anyone — including us — when it need not. The volunteer
       proxies stay LAST, as the fallback for a build with no Supabase URL configured. */

    /* ══ (#R355) THE ROUTES COME FROM THIS APP'S OWN ORIGIN NOW ═══════════════════════════════════
       「世界中の全海底ケーブルが…実際に海底を通っていると考えられる場所に描画され」

       What used to be drawn here was TeleGeography's SCHEMATIC geometry — 702 cables in 1,933 rings
       and 14,103 vertices, a median of FOUR points per leg — fetched live, through a relay, from an
       origin that sends no ACAO. scripts/build-subcables.mjs now rebuilds every route offline from
       surveyed government route data where it exists and a least-cost path over the sea floor where
       it does not, and the result SHIPS WITH THE APP as data/subcables*.json.

       ⚠ THAT MAKES THE LAYER MORE ROBUST, NOT LESS, AND THE ORDER IS WHY. The brief's §3 forbids
       trading display reliability for route accuracy, so the four sources are tried strictly in
       order of how little can go wrong with them:

         1. data/subcables.json — the app's own origin, same deploy, no CORS, no third party. If the
            page loaded, this loads.
         2. the Cache API copy of (1) — written on every success, so a second visit paints with no
            network at all, and an offline start still paints. (The service worker deliberately
            keeps `intmap-subcables-*` across deploys; see sw.js.)
         3. the Cache API copy of the TeleGeography answer — what #R188 put there. Every browser that
            has ever shown this layer still has one.
         4. the TeleGeography relay chain — #R190's Edge Function, then the volunteer proxies.

       Steps 3 and 4 are the MIGRATION path the brief's §3 asks to be kept: a build that somehow
       shipped without the dataset still draws cables, exactly as it did before this round. Nothing
       below touches the layer's paint, its layout, its order or its default state. */

           「デフォルトでは、ケッペンと海底ケーブルレイヤーがオンが初期状態に。（追記：片方しかつかない）」

           Reproduced on a cold first load, and the console says it outright:
               addSubcables Error: Style is not done loading.
           whenStyleReady() resolves for real when the style is parsed, but it also HARD-RESOLVES
           after ~6 s (#R41 put that there because the promise could otherwise hang forever and the
           layer would never appear at all). On a slow first load — and #R186 measured that its own two
           new default layers push "ready" from 3.2 s to 9.2 s, so this load is exactly the slow one —
           the hard resolve wins, MapLibre refuses addSource, and the old code logged the refusal and
           stopped. The box stayed ticked, the row stayed lit, and the layer did not exist: one of the
           two default layers on screen, which is the report.

           Köppen survives the same race because its branch polls for `lyr-climate` for 5 s and calls
           setVis when it appears. This gives the cables the same persistence at the point where it
           actually failed: build, and if the style refused, wait and build again. Bounded (12 tries
           over ~9 s), abandoned the moment the user unticks the box, and a no-op once the layers are
           there — so the successful path is byte-for-byte what it was. */
        /* ══ (#R355) THE LADDER IS TIED TO THE STYLE, NOT TO A STOPWATCH ═══════════════════════════
           #R187's ladder is twelve tries at 750 ms — about nine seconds — and it was measured
           against a style that was merely SLOW. Measured this round on a machine whose basemap host
           was answering 429/503: `isStyleLoaded()` was still false at 22 s, every addSource threw
           "Style is not done loading.", the ladder ran out, and the box was unticked with
           `imAutoOff` — correct bookkeeping for the wrong outcome.

           ⚠ AND THIS ROUND MADE THAT RACE TIGHTER, WHICH IS WHY IT IS FIXED HERE. The routes now
           come from this app's own origin: measured, `data/subcables.json` answers in 12 ms where
           the relay took seconds. Arriving earlier means arriving while the style is less ready.

           So the ladder keeps its 750 ms rhythm and stops asking a clock whether to continue: it
           continues while the box is ticked and the horizon has not passed, and — the part that
           actually matters — it retries THE MOMENT the renderer says the style changed, instead of
           waiting out the next tick. A style that becomes usable at 40 s now paints at 40 s.
           ⚠ `on`, not `once`: a `styledata` that has already fired never fires again for a listener
           registered afterwards, and this listener is registered after the first refusal by
           construction. It is removed on success, on giving up, and when the box is unticked. */

       「降水レーダー（実時間）レイヤーはある程度以上ズームしたら zoom level not supported と
         透かしがなります」
       MEASURED against tilecache.rainviewer.com on 2026-08-28, four continents, both tile sizes:
         z4-z7  real radar (neighbouring tiles differ from one another: 435 B – 19,100 B)
         z8+    ONE byte-identical 1,370 B PNG everywhere — a grey plate reading
                「Zoom Level Not Supported」. HTTP **200**. Same at z9…z15, over Tokyo / New York /
                London / Miami / Sydney, at /256/ and at /512/.
       ⚠ This is #R479's shape again: the request SUCCEEDS and the failure is painted into the
       image, so no error path, no onerror, no tile-count instrument can ever see it. The only
       place it is visible is the source's own zoom ceiling — which said **12**, five levels past
       the data, so MapLibre and Cesium dutifully asked for z8…z12 and got the plate back.
       ⚠ The fix is NOT to hide the layer above z7. Overzooming the z7 tile keeps the rain field on
       screen at every zoom, which is what the reader asked for, and the free mosaic is ~2 km/px:
       z7 (~1.2 km/px at the equator) is already at its native resolution, so the stretch adds
       blur, not error. ⚠ Do not raise this number again — a taller ceiling does not buy detail the
       free tier has, it buys the grey plate. */

       「プレート境界レイヤーのプレート名は透過するな」 — MEASURED: `getPaintProperty('eco-plates-lbl',

       「プレートは30%から」 default (line below) travelling through this function, which dims a symbol
       layer's TEXT along with everything else the checkbox owns.

       That default is about the plate POLYGONS — a filled overlay at full strength hides the map under
       it, which is what 30 % was asked for. A label is not a wash over the map, it is the map's answer
       to "which plate is this", and at 0.3 over a light basemap it is barely there. So a layer can
       declare that its TEXT stays opaque while its fills and lines keep following the slider. The
       registry is a plain id→true map so the declaration lives next to the layer that needs it
       (js/layer-packs.js) rather than as a special case in here. */

       「日本含め警報の塗漏れ、塗りすぎが多すぎる。」 MEASURED on the built app with the warnings layer
       on: `getPaint('wp-alert-hatch','fill-opacity')` came back **0.38** — a plain number. That
       layer is declared with

       overwrote it with the slider's value, so every country on Earth — including the ones with
       warnings in force — was hatched at 38 %. That is the 「塗りすぎ」 in the report, and it is
       also why the hatch looked like a sheet over the whole map rather than a state.
       #R273 hit the same mechanism one property along (`line-opacity` on the outline) and answered
       it with `_opacityOpaqueText`, which is a per-layer EXEMPTION. An exemption is the wrong shape
       here: the reader does want the hatch to follow the slider — what they do not want is the
       slider deciding WHO is hatched.

      /* (#R79) The audit was RIGHT but too SLOW: on a 15s cadence a checked-but-blank layer (source failed,
         or a base-map/style swap wiped the overlay and nothing re-added it) stayed visibly wrong for up to
         ~30s — that latency IS the "レイヤーのオンオフが実情と対応していないことがある" the user still notices.
         Trigger the SAME audit() (same thresholds, same 2-hit debounce, same 4-min heal cooldown) shortly
         after the map SETTLES (idle → every engine's styledata re-add has run) and when the tab regains
         focus (a background wipe otherwise waited out the whole 15s). So real desyncs now self-heal in a
         couple of seconds instead of half a minute — no new heal logic, just more trigger points. */
