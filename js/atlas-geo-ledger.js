 *  IntMap · ATLAS — THE PLACES A TURN RESOLVED, AS DATA  (#R489)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  「回答時点で各場所を型付きデータとして保存し、そのまま再利用すること。」
 *
 *  ══ THE MEASUREMENT ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  A turn answered a question about drone interceptions and named fourteen Russian oblasts in its
 *  prose. The reader said 「マッピングして」. What crossed the turn boundary was NOTHING: the only
 *  record one turn leaves for the next is js/atlas-turn-continuity.js's `actionLabel`, which is the
 *  action type plus TWENTY-SIX CHARACTERS of one argument. So the next turn re-extracted the same
 *  fourteen names OUT OF ITS OWN PROSE, as Japanese strings with no country and no kind, and went
 *  round this loop for each of them:
 *
 *      「ベルゴロド州」 → highlight → no boundary → translate to English → retry → fly to Russia
 *          → look the oblast up on the web → retry → 「実在しない」
 *
 *  Every step of that had already been done. The turn that WROTE the prose knew the country was
 *  Russia, knew each name was a first-level administrative unit, and in most cases already had a
 *  coordinate for it. It knew, and then it threw the knowledge away and printed a sentence instead.
 *
 *  ⚠ THE STRING IS THE DEFECT, not the geocoder. A place that has been resolved once is a FACT
 *  about this conversation — kind, country, canonical name, a stable identifier, where it is, and
 *  what role it played in the answer. This file is where that fact lives, and it lives for the
 *  whole conversation rather than for one action.
 *
 *  ══ WHAT IT DOES NOT DO ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  ⚠ IT DECIDES NOTHING FOR ATLAS (CONSTITUTION.md §5). It does not choose what to map, refuse a
 *  name, cap anything, or geocode. It REMEMBERS what was already resolved and hands it back — so
 *  Atlas spends its authority on the question instead of on the same fourteen lookups twice.
 *
 *  ⚠ NO DOM, NO NETWORK, NO GLOBALS — the `window` publish is in a try/catch — so
 *  tests/r489-checks.test.mjs drives THIS module, the one the browser runs, with no browser. That
 *  is the js/atlas-turn-continuity.js and js/atlas-turn-results.js pattern, and it is also why the
 *  subject is its own file: js/atlas-console.js has a shrink-only line ceiling (tests/r318 ⓑ).
