/* ============================================================================
 *  IntMap · CHRONOS — the spacetime kernel   (#R94, named and moved out #R289)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  「IntMap統一時間機能を、これよりChronosという名称に。」 The one master clock the whole app
 *  runs on. It was declared inside js/app-body.js's DOMContentLoaded closure; naming it is what
 *  made it a subject, and a subject gets its own file (tests/r168 #8 — the shell's ceiling comes
 *  DOWN, never up, and this round adds to the shell).
 *
 *  ⚠ NOTHING ABOUT IT CHANGED IN THE MOVE. The body below is #R94's, word for word, with two
 *  edits and no others:
 *    · `ymdISO` was a helper in the closure and is four characters of arithmetic — it is declared
 *      here rather than reached for;
 *    · `newsDate` — the recent-archive facet — was ASSIGNED from inside broadcast(). It is a
 *      js/app-body.js closure variable and cannot be assigned from another file, so app-body now
 *      keeps it in lock-step through an ordinary subscriber, registered FIRST, which is the same
 *      guarantee the inline assignment gave: every later subscriber still sees the fresh value.
 *
 *  ⚠ IT IS NOW PUBLISHED AT IMPORT TIME rather than at DOMContentLoaded, which is strictly
 *  earlier than before — no module could have subscribed in between, because every factory is
 *  called from js/app-body.js, which is imported last.
 *
 *  ⚠ THE NAME `window.IntMapTime` DOES NOT CHANGE. 「Chronos」 is what the reader calls it; the
 *  global is what ~30 files call it, and renaming a contract to match a label would be a rename
 *  for its own sake. The panel (js/news-timeline.js) is where the name is spoken.
 * ==========================================================================*/
/* (#R94)'s own note, kept because it is the argument for the design:
 *  INTMAP TIME — the SPACETIME KERNEL. One master clock the whole app runs on.
 *  The time slider, the date/year inputs, Earth Replay and Atlas all WRITE to this
 *  single kernel; every time-aware subsystem (news, the dated NASA rasters, the
 *  Countries statistics, the NATO/EU accession fills, historical borders, the Köppen
 *  climate era and the day/night terminator) SUBSCRIBES to it (IntMapTime.on) and
 *  reconstructs itself for the chosen instant. `newsDate` stays the recent-archive
 *  facet (kept in lock-step) so every existing news/raster reader is untouched; the
 *  kernel adds deep-time reach (back to 1850 — #R349; it was 1900) for the subsystems that carry a real
 *  historical series. Single source of truth = _when (a Date, or null = LIVE/now).
 *  When LIVE, every subsystem holds its own independent default; the moment you travel
 *  to a past instant they all sync to it, and returning to "Now" releases them. ====== */

  /* ⚠ (#R349) THE FLOOR IS THE CLOCK'S, NOT ANY ONE SUBSYSTEM'S. 「1850年までさかのぼれるように。
     （1900までと完全に同様に。単に対応年を延長するだけです。）」 Every subsystem below reaches as far
     back as ITS OWN SOURCE reaches and says so where it stops — the kernel does not pretend they all
     stop together, and it never clamps a reader to the shortest of them:
       · borders      day-exact for the WHOLE reach since #R518: CShapes 2.0 from 1886-01-01 to 2019,
                      OpenHistoricalMap (data/hist-borders.js) from 1850 to 1885. The
                      historical-basemaps snapshots are now only the fallback for both bands.
       · GDP / pop    Maddison Project 2020, now carried back to 1850 (data/maddison.json — measured, not
                      declared: js/history.js reads the smallest year in the shipped file).
       · climate era  the oldest Köppen period that exists is 1901-1930; earlier years show it and
                      are labelled with the period, so nobody reads 1850 weather off a 1901 raster.
     Lowering this number is therefore the whole of «extend the supported years» for the kernel; what
     each subsystem does with a year it cannot source is that subsystem's own answer. */
