 *  IntMap · THE NIGHT SIDE OF THE EARTH — window.IntMapNightSide  (#R196 → rebuilt #R201)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  「地球全体が見えるズームレベルから、さらにズームアウトするほど、太陽の当たっていない部分が暗くなり、
 *    夜間光が見えるように。」
 *  追記①「引いたときの黒さをよりきつくして。」  追記②「夜と昼の部分の変遷が階段状で不自然。
 *    また、夜の部分は完全に夜間光レイヤーと同じ画像に。」
 *
 *  ── WHAT #R196/#R200 BUILT, AND WHY THE SECOND ADDENDUM IS A DESIGN REPORT, NOT A TUNING REQUEST ──
 *  The old night side was TWO things stacked: five nested geographic polygons at solar elevations
 *  0°, −3°, −6°, −9°, −12° carrying the darkness, and a canvas of NASA's VIIRS Black Marble drawn
 *  only where its own pixels were bright enough to be a city. #R200 fixed the arithmetic behind the
 *  first (alpha does not add; five coats of 0.156 leave 43 % of the basemap, not 22 %) and the
 *  measured darkness went 0.57 → 0.87. It did not — could not — fix the shape:
 *
 *    · FIVE POLYGONS ARE FIVE STEPS. The twilight band spans 0° to −12° of solar elevation, which at
 *      the whole-Earth zoom this effect lives at is about 17 SCREEN PIXELS wide. Five hard-edged
 *      fills inside 17 px is a staircase by construction, and no choice of five alphas is not one.
 *      「階段状で不自然」 is a description of the mechanism, so the mechanism is what changed.
 *    · AND THE NIGHT WAS NOT THE NIGHT-LIGHTS IMAGE. The lights layer skipped every pixel dimmer
 *      than 2 % (`lum<=0.02 → alpha 0`) and brightened the rest, so what you actually saw over dark
 *      land and over ocean was the ordinary basemap with a dark polygon on top — a shaded day map,
 *      not the night side. 「完全に夜間光レイヤーと同じ画像に」 says: at full night, show the product.
 *
 *  ── WHAT IT IS NOW: ONE IMAGE, ONE GRADIENT, PER PIXEL ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *  A single canvas source whose RGB is Black Marble UNTOUCHED and whose ALPHA is the nightness at
 *  that pixel — smoothstepped from the sunlit horizon (0°) to the end of astronomical twilight
 *  (−18°, which is the definition of night rather than a number chosen to look right). So:
 *
 *      composite = BlackMarble·n + basemap·(1−n)
 *
 *  At n = 1 that is EXACTLY the `dl-nightsat` layer — same GIBS product, same 2016-01-01 composite,
 *  same pixels, nothing added — which is what the request asks for, and because Black Marble is
 *  near-black wherever nobody lives, it is also the darkest the night side has ever been. At n = 0
 *  the basemap is untouched. In between the alpha varies PER PIXEL, so the terminator has as many
 *  levels as it has pixels: the staircase is not smoothed, it is gone.
 *
 *  ⚠ THE DARKNESS NO LONGER NEEDS THE NETWORK EITHER. The mosaic arrives on an idle, so until it
 *  does the same canvas is painted with UNLIT — the value Black Marble itself carries where there
 *  is no light (measured off the product, see the constant) — and the night side is complete and
 *  correctly shaped from the first frame. The lights are then a REFINEMENT of an image that is
 *  already right, which is also why the mosaic is fetched twice: z2 (16 tiles) so it is there
 *  almost at once, then z3 (64 tiles, 2048²) to match the canvas the desktop paints.
 *
 *  ⚠ THE POLES ARE THE ONE THING A CANVAS CANNOT DO, so they are the one thing still drawn as
 *  polygons. A canvas source is a QUAD placed by four corner coordinates and Mercator Y is unbounded
 *  at the pole, so the image stops at ±85.051129° — on the globe projection that leaves a cap the
 *  night would otherwise miss. `im-night-shade` is now ONLY that cap: a fan of wedges from ±85° to
 *  the pole, each carrying its own nightness as a feature property. It is 0.19 % of the sphere.
 *
 *  ⚠ THE IMAGE IS PLACED THROUGH `imageRowLatitudes` (#R195). A canvas source's texture runs
 *  linearly in the RENDERER's vertical coordinate — Mercator on MapLibre, geographic on Cesium.
 *  Sampling at equal steps of latitude and hoping is exactly the 8.05° error #R195 measured on the
 *  tsunami. Every output row asks the engine what latitude it is.
 *
 *  ⚠ NOTHING RUNS PER FRAME, AND NOTHING RUNS AT ALL UNTIL IT WOULD BE VISIBLE. The zoom ramp is a
 *  style EXPRESSION (`interpolate` on zoom), so panning and zooming cost the renderer what they
 *  already cost and this file zero. The layers are not created — and no tile is fetched — until the
 *  camera first reaches a zoom where the effect has any opacity.
 *
 *  DATA: NASA EOSDIS GIBS, VIIRS_Black_Marble (2016-01-01 composite). Already declared in the app's
 *  sources/privacy pages for the manual layer; this is the same service and the same product.

  /* ══ ⚠⚠ (#R220) THE BLACK DISC ON THE POLE — 「南極付近が真っ暗」, 7回目 ═════════════════════════
     The report finally came with a photograph, and the photograph is unambiguous: the ice sheet is
     LIT, and sitting on the pole is a hard-edged black disc with the seams of a 24-spoke fan in it.
     That is this layer, and it was wrong in two ways at once.

     ① ONE NIGHTNESS FOR FIVE DEGREES OF LATITUDE. The fan sampled n(87.5°) and painted the whole
        85°→90° wedge with it, while the image below it varies per pixel. #R201's note claims the
        seam «is zero except in the few days around an equinox»; that is exactly backwards. Near a
        SOLSTICE the winter pole is in full night (n = 1) while 85° is still in twilight (n ≈ 0.4),
        so the step across the join is at its LARGEST — measured this round at the reported date.
        A disc, with a visible edge, on a lit ice sheet. → the cap is now a GRID: bands in latitude
        as well as wedges in longitude, each cell carrying the nightness at its own centre, so it
        continues the image's gradient instead of stepping off it.
     ② THE CAP COULD SURVIVE ITS OWN IMAGE. `build()` adds the dynamic image FIRST, then the cap,
        and only then checks `hasDynamicImage` — returning false without removing anything. On a
        device where that image does not come up, `built` stays false (so `refresh()` never runs
        again) and the fan is left on the map ALONE, permanently, at whatever nightness it was born
        with: a black disc over a globe with no night side at all, which is precisely the picture in
        the photograph. → the failure path now destroys what it built, and the cap is only ever
        drawn as the 0.19 % of the sphere the image cannot reach.
     ⚠ CAP_LAT and CAP_WEDGES keep their names and their meaning — tests/r201-checks ①d reads both
     out of this file by regex, and the invariant it protects (the cap must overlap the image's
     ±85.051° edge by a hairline and no more) is unchanged. */
  const CAP_LAT=85.0, CAP_WEDGES=180;
  /* ⚠ THE JOIN, NOT THE MIDDLE. Each wedge takes the nightness the IMAGE has at the latitude where
     the two meet, so the cap starts at exactly the value its neighbour ends at and the seam is zero
     by construction — instead of n(87.5°), which near a solstice is a whole twilight away from
     n(85°) and is what drew a black disc on a lit ice sheet. Inside the cap the value is then held
     rather than deepened: over 0.19 % of the sphere that is invisible, and it makes the pole

  /* ══ (#R196) THIS IS THE MapLibre IMPLEMENTATION OF SOMETHING CESIUM ALREADY HAS ══════════════════
     ⚠ MEASURED, AND IT WAS A REAL REGRESSION. Built on Cesium, these layers stopped the camera:
     `tests/r182-cesium.spec.js` ③ («easeTo lands on the camera it was asked for») passed on main in
     33.8 s and FAILED here — the camera never left its starting longitude at all — and passed again
     the moment this module was switched off. Whole-globe clamped-to-ground polygons are not a cheap
     thing to hand Cesium, and a scene that cannot finish a frame cannot finish a camera flight.

     It is also unnecessary there. Cesium's globe has REAL solar lighting (`globe.enableLighting`),
     and js/cesium-engine.js turns it on from exactly the call this round now makes for every
     basemap — `scene.setSunDirection()`, the same one that aims MapLibre's atmosphere. So Cesium
     gets its night side from its own renderer, computed per fragment, and this module is what gives
     MapLibre — which has no such thing — the same effect.
     ⚠ WHAT CESIUM THEREFORE DOES NOT HAVE is the zoom ramp and the VIIRS city lights. Cesium's
     ImageryLayer has `dayAlpha`/`nightAlpha` for exactly that; wiring the Black Marble layer through
     them is the way to do it there, and it is NOT done here rather than shipped unverified. */

     「昼夜で夜間光にしたり明るくしたり暗くしたりするやつはSatellite時のみに。Mapではなにも無し。」

     What this module composites is a PHOTOGRAPH — NASA's Black Marble, pixel for pixel (see the
     header). Over the satellite basemap that is one photograph fading into another and it reads as
     the Earth at night. Over the vector map it is a photograph laid on a drawing: the cartography
     underneath keeps its own flat colours and the mosaic simply darkens them, which is not "night",
     it is a dark filter over a diagram. So the effect now asks WHICH BASEMAP IS UP.

     ⚠ The test is the one js/app-body.js itself uses for the same question — `layer-sat` being
     visible — so the two cannot disagree about what "satellite" means. It is asked through the
     renderer contract, not through MapLibre (#R178).
     ⚠ AND THE SWITCH IS NOT THE SETTING. `enabled` is still the user's own choice and is still
     remembered; this is a second condition on top of it, so turning day/night off in Settings and
     switching basemaps do not fight over the same flag. */

       「モバイル版がまだ劇的に遅い…地図のスクロール、ズームが困難」(iPhone / iOS Safari, 5回目)

       This line used to be a bare `return`, and the comment on RAMP_STOPS above it has said
       「reaching 0 at ZMAX where nothing is built」 since #R201 — the code did the opposite of its own
       comment (#R212's shape of defect). The guard only ever stopped the layers being BUILT; it never
       removed ones that already existed. The app opens at z1.7, which is inside the ramp, so on every
       cold load with the satellite basemap up both layers ARE built — and then the reader zooms in to
       actually use the map and they are never taken down again.

       So at every working zoom (z5 → z22: a city, a coastline, terrain) the renderer was drawing, on
       every frame of every pan and every pinch:
         · `im-night-lights-lyr` — a FULL-SCREEN raster of the Black Marble canvas source, at
           raster-opacity 0
         · `im-night-shade`      — a FULL-SCREEN fill of the polar wedges, at fill-opacity 0
       plus holding the canvas source's mosaic and its GPU texture resident the whole time. Not one
       pixel of it can ever reach the screen: the ramp is 0 from z4.6 up, by construction.

       ⚠ THIS IS NOT A QUALITY DECISION AND NOTHING VISIBLE CHANGES. Both layers are already fully
       transparent everywhere this branch is reached; `destroy()` removes exactly what the ramp has
       already multiplied to nothing. Coming back down under z5.0 rebuilds them through the same
       `consider()` that built them the first time, on the same `moveend`.
       ⚠ Symmetric with the build threshold on purpose — one `moveend` can build or destroy, never
       both, so a camera resting near z5 cannot oscillate. */
