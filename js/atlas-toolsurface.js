/* ============================================================================
 *  IntMap · ATLAS — WHAT ATLAS IS HANDED, INSTEAD OF THE WHOLE CATALOGUE  (#R406)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  「全Capabilityカタログを毎回SYSへ入れる方式を廃止すること。」
 *
 *  WHAT WAS THERE. js/atlas-catalog-text.js holds 41 prose blocks, 64,250 characters, documenting
 *  126 capabilities. `selectCapabilities()` was supposed to send a relevant slice; measured, it
 *  sent 41,178 characters for 「ありがとう」 and the SAME 41,178 for 「東京の天気は？」, because the
 *  score that decides inclusion was a +10 bonus for `produces:'explanation'` — awarded to 23
 *  capabilities whenever the request profile guessed the reader wanted prose, which it guessed for
 *  almost everything. The selection was not reading the sentence. Two of its four output signals,
 *  `comparison` and `navigation`, match no capability at all and never did.
 *
 *  WHAT IS HERE. A handful of typed tools that cover most turns, plus DISCOVERY for the other
 *  hundred-odd. Atlas asks for what it needs and gets that capability's real schema; nothing is
 *  pushed at it on the chance it might be relevant.
 *
 *  ⚠ NOTHING IS TAKEN AWAY. `find_capability` searches the whole registry and `run_capability` invokes any of
 *  them, so the reachable surface is the whole registry — CONSTITUTION.md §0.3. What shrinks is
 *  what is SENT, not what can be DONE.
 *
 *  ⚠ AND EXECUTION GOES DOWN THE PATH IT ALWAYS DID. A tool call becomes the same legacy action
 *  object the dispatch at js/atlas-console.js:1785 has always taken, so every pin, overlay, panel
 *  and rendering behaviour is the one that shipped. This file changes how an action is CHOSEN and
 *  CHECKED, never what an action does.

       matches; `search()` breaks equal scores with `a.id.localeCompare(b.id)`, so the ALPHABET decided
       which capabilities Atlas was allowed to know about. Measured on 「現在地から大阪駅までの経路」:
       ten capabilities score 16 — identically, because the only signal a Japanese request produces is
       the per-CATEGORY hint row, which awards the same points to every member of the category. Sorted
       by id the first eight are navigation.camera, navigation.start, navigation.status,
       navigation.stop, navigation.voice, routing.drone, routing.isochrone, routing.optimizeStops —
       and `routing.route`, the one capability that answers the request, is NINTH. It was dropped, and
       all five navigation.* that arrived instead reply «plan a route first». Atlas asked the reader to
       type their own address because IntMap had just handed it a toolkit that could not draw a route.
       The fix is not a bigger number. `search()` already scores the whole registry and already returns
       only what MATCHED — Atlas gets that, and decides for itself. */

         none of them — it wrote the paragraph on step 0. This is that act as ONE call, so choosing
         the map costs Atlas one decision. It resolves every place through the ledger first and the

IntMap resolves every name itself (ledger first, then geocoder — never write coordinates), numbers the markers, draws the arcs, frames the camera over everything that landed, shows a legend with the same numbers, and links the names in your final_text to the markers.
