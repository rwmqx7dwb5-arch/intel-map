  sourceUse: {
    "Smithsonian / USGS Weekly Volcanic Activity Report": "The worldwide rung of the volcano status ladder: which volcanoes an observatory reported on this week, and what it said. Each item carries the GVP volcano number, so the report is joined to the catalog by number rather than by name. Relayed by supabase/functions/volcano-feed because volcano.si.edu sends no CORS header.",
    "USGS Volcano Hazards Program — HANS (alert levels, aviation colour codes, VONA)": "The United States rung: the aviation colour code and volcano alert level currently in force, and every Volcano Observatory Notice for Aviation of the last year. Read directly by the browser — the service sends Access-Control-Allow-Origin.",
    "USGS Volcano Hazards Program — published volcano hazard zones": "The only authoritative, machine-readable volcano hazard-zone service found: ashfall, lahar, flood, near-vent and lava-flow polygons for seven volcanic centres in California. Drawn where it exists; for every other volcano the card says plainly that no such data is published, and no modelled circle is ever drawn.",
    "噴火警報・予報 — 気象庁 (JMA volcano warnings and eruption warning levels)": "The Japan rung: the eruption warning level (1–5) currently in force, or the worded warning where JMA does not operate a level for that volcano. JMA warns for its own unit — 桜島, not the Aira caldera it sits in — so the card shows JMA’s unit name and the map colours the GVP volcano that contains it.",
    "International SIGMET (volcanic ash) — NOAA Aviation Weather Center": "The volcanic-ash areas actually in force: the SIGMET a flight information region issues from a VAAC advisory, with the polygon and the flight-level band it was promulgated with. Relayed by supabase/functions/volcano-feed, which keeps only the volcanic-ash ones.",
    "NASA GIBS — OMPS SO₂, upper troposphere & stratosphere": "The satellite sulphur-dioxide column, in the altitude band where an eruption plume appears rather than where industrial haze does. GVP’s own SO₂ emission table is advertised by its WFS and is broken upstream, so this is the measurement that exists.",
    "CRUST1.0 — global crustal model": "Bundled with the app (data/crust1.bin.gz): the 1° global crustal model — sediment, crystalline crust and uppermost mantle, each with its own shear velocity, density and layer depth. The earthquake simulator builds every site's velocity profile below 30 m from it, which is what lets it show a basin amplifying long periods.",
    "USGS Slab2 — subduction zone geometry": "Bundled with the app (data/slab2.bin.gz): the depth, strike and dip of all 27 active subduction zones. The earthquake simulator uses it to tell a plate-interface earthquake from one inside the descending slab — the same question, and the same answer, everywhere on Earth.",
    "Bird (2003) PB2002 plate boundaries": "Bundled with the app (data/tectonics.bin.gz): distance to the nearest plate boundary, that boundary's class and the diffuse-deformation (orogen) polygons. Used to classify an earthquake's tectonic setting, which selects the published ground-motion parameters for it.",
    "USGS ShakeMap station lists": "Recorded peak ground acceleration and velocity at real instruments, used to score the earthquake model against observations (scripts/seismic-validate.mjs). Fetched only when that validation is run offline — never by the app in your browser.",
    "CARTO basemaps": "Light/dark vector basemap tiles",
    "MapLibre GL JS": "The default map rendering engine (BSD-3-Clause). Draws every 2-D/3-D map view, the globe projection and the terrain mesh.",
    "CesiumJS": "Optional second rendering engine (Apache-2.0), selectable in Settings ▸ Map behavior ▸ Map engine. Downloaded only when chosen. Uses NO Cesium Ion asset and no access token — it renders the same Esri imagery and the same AWS terrarium elevation data as the default engine.",

    "Esri World Imagery": "Satellite imagery + reference labels; World Hillshade & World Transportation reference tiles (hillshade layer and the roads-layer preview image)",
    "OpenStreetMap": "Place search & place/region boundary outlines (Nominatim), the real course of a river when its name is clicked on the map, & basemap data",
    "NASA GIBS / Worldview": "Temperature, precipitation, SST, sea-ice concentration & SST anomaly, snow, aerosol & UV-aerosol index, carbon monoxide, soil moisture, fires, vegetation (NDVI) and shaded relief, and geostationary clean-infrared cloud imagery (Himawari, GOES-East, GOES-West)",
    "NASA Blue Marble (via NASA EOSDIS GIBS)": "The whole-Earth base picture bundled with the app (data/world-basemap.jpg — Blue Marble: Shaded Relief and Bathymetry, 2048×1024 equirectangular). It is drawn UNDER the satellite tiles so the globe is never blank while they load, and — because it is equirectangular rather than Web Mercator — it is also the OFFLINE floor for the polar caps beyond ±85.05° in the Cesium engine, where Mercator tiles cannot reach. Above it there, the caps are drawn from NASA GIBS’s tiled EPSG:4326 service (Blue Marble: Shaded Relief and Bathymetry, 500 m), because a single equirectangular image has only ONE row of pixels for its topmost 0.176° of latitude and stretches that row into a radial smear across the whole cap. Both follow the satellite basemap. In the MapLibre engine, where a single equirectangular image cannot be draped over the globe at all, the same picture is used one step more coarsely: the AVERAGE COLOR of its polar rows is measured at runtime and painted as the layer beneath everything, so the caps beyond ±85.05° are ice rather than the renderer’s clear color. That color is a measurement of this imagery, not a chosen value. Rebuilt by scripts/build-world-basemap.mjs.",
    "NOAA sea-surface currents, wind stress and temperature (CoastWatch / PolarWatch ERDDAP)": "The ocean-current layer — 108 named currents (data/ocean-currents.json) plus the flow field as a GRID rather than a list of arrows: data/ocean-currents-field.bin.gz is the source’s own 0.25° mesh, 1,440 × 720 cells with 466,007 of them carrying flow, one byte of speed and one of bearing, and the client chooses its own spacing from the view. data/ocean-currents-months.bin.gz adds twelve monthly climatologies at 0.5° (six years of each calendar month), fetched only if a month is chosen. Rebuilt from the same three NOAA products. ⚠ The arrows and the PATHS are measured: a CLIMATOLOGICAL mean of fields spread across the whole served record, kept on the source’s own 0.25° grid, with each named current traced through that field by numerical integration (RK2, 25 km steps, loop- and closure-detecting) from a published seed on its core. Only the NAME and the seed are editorial; no geometry is copied from any map. The velocity is NOAA CoastWatch’s blended GEOSTROPHIC surface current from multi-mission satellite altimetry (Sentinel-3A/B, CryoSat-2, Jason-2/3, SARAL), and the wind-driven part is added from NOAA NCEI blended wind stress through the drifter-fitted relation of Ralph & Niiler (1999) — |u| = B·|τ|/(ρ√f), 55° cum sole, tapered inside 2.5° of the equator, which is the same decomposition OSCAR itself is built from. ⚠ WARM OR COLD IS NOW MEASURED, not derived from the flow: it is each current’s own SST against the zonal mean at the same latitude (NOAA OISST v2.1) — the textbook definition — and it is what puts the Canary (−2.9 K), California (−2.3 K), Peru (−3.1 K) and Benguela (−1.2 K) on the cold side, where the previous derivation had three of them warm or neutral. Within ±0.6 K the current is drawn grey, because the equatorial and circumpolar currents really do run along their own isotherms. All three are U.S. Government works in the public domain; the altimetric product is generated using AVISO+. Rebuilt by scripts/build-ocean-currents.mjs.",
    "JPL Solar System Dynamics — planetary satellites": "The 177 moons drawn around the other planets (data/moons.json) — mean orbital elements INCLUDING the mean anomaly at epoch 2000-01-01.5 TDB, which is the number that makes a moon’s position an answer rather than an arrangement, plus each satellite’s own reference plane (the ecliptic, or that planet’s local Laplace plane with its pole). Mean radii from the companion physical-parameters table. Rebuilt by scripts/build-moons.mjs.",
    "Hipparcos Catalog (ESA 1997) — CDS I/239": "The 98,887 stars behind the globe in dark mode (data/stars.bin — right ascension, declination, V magnitude, B−V color index and the measured parallax, to V 9.5). Positions are precessed from J2000 to the map’s own clock and rotated by Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time, so the sky is the real sky for that instant; sizes come from the measured magnitudes and colors from the measured B−V. Going this far past the naked-eye limit is also what draws the Milky Way: that band is not a painted gradient, it is where the stars actually are. Served by the Strasbourg astronomical Data Center (CDS); the Bright Star Catalog (Hoffleit & Warren 1991, Harvard–Smithsonian TDC) remains the build’s fallback source. Rebuilt by scripts/build-star-catalog.mjs.",
    "NASA/JPL Horizons — interplanetary spacecraft trajectories": "The “Spacecraft” population in Explore space (data/spacecraft.json): 17 vehicles — Voyager 1 and 2, Pioneer 10 and 11, New Horizons, Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, Juno, JUICE, Europa Clipper, Lucy, Psyche, BepiColombo, Hayabusa2, OSIRIS-APEX, JWST and Gaia. Heliocentric J2000-ecliptic position AND velocity sampled at a per-spacecraft step (90 days for Voyager, 3 days for Parker), interpolated on the client with a cubic Hermite so the reconstructed path is reproduced rather than chorded. ⚠ Horizons answers without CORS headers, so this is fetched at BUILD time and bundled; and ⚠ a trajectory is not telemetry — Pioneer 10 and 11 stopped answering in 2003 and 1995 and Gaia was passivated in 2025, so what is drawn for them is a propagated position, which the panel says outright. Outside a kernel’s stated coverage the app says the file does not know rather than repeating the last point silently. U.S. Government work — not subject to copyright. Rebuilt by scripts/build-spacecraft.mjs.",
    "NASA/JPL Small-Body Database (SBDB)": "The “Asteroids & comets” population in Explore space (data/small-bodies.json): 1,142 objects. The bulk sets are defined by measurement, not by taste — every asteroid at least 150 km across, every trans-Neptunian object brighter than H 5.5, every NUMBERED (i.e. confirmed-returning) comet, and every potentially hazardous asteroid brighter than H 18 — plus an explicitly editorial list of spacecraft targets and famous bodies, including the three interstellar objects. Osculating heliocentric elements, propagated two-body on the client: elliptic from the time of perihelion, hyperbolic for e>1 and Barker’s equation at e=1. ⚠ Osculating elements describe the orbit at ONE epoch; planetary perturbations (and, for an active comet, non-gravitational jetting) move the real body off that ellipse over years. Good enough to see where a body is in the solar system, not good enough to point a telescope. SBDB has no CORS headers, so this is bundled at build time. U.S. Government work. Rebuilt by scripts/build-smallbodies.mjs.",
    "SIMBAD — CDS, Strasbourg (deep-sky objects and their published distances)": "The “Beyond the solar system” population in Explore space (data/deep-sky.json): 150 objects — all 110 Messier objects plus the Local Group, the nearest large galaxies, the Galactic Centre and the Virgo, Coma, Fornax and Sculptor groups. Positions and object types from SIMBAD’s `basic` table; the distance is the MEDIAN of every distance measurement SIMBAD carries for that object (`mesDistance`), with the number of measurements and the quartiles kept beside it. ⚠ A published distance is a measurement with a method behind it, and methods disagree — Cepheids, the tip of the red-giant branch, Tully-Fisher, surface-brightness fluctuation and redshift can differ by tens of per cent, which is what the quartiles state. 131 of the 150 have a published distance; the other 19 are drawn on the celestial sphere WITHOUT depth rather than being given an invented one. This is also what sets how far the camera may pull back: the ceiling is the furthest measured object (about 72 Mpc), not an arbitrary number. Wenger et al. 2000, A&AS 143, 9 — please cite SIMBAD if you reuse it. Rebuilt by scripts/build-deepsky.mjs.",
    "Country facts — mledoze/countries (capital, currency, languages, land borders, UN membership, demonym; ODbL 1.0, build time only)": "The reference facts on the country card — capital, currency, official languages, the neighbours a country shares a LAND border with, UN membership and demonym (data/country-facts.json). ⚠ BUNDLED, NOT FETCHED. REST Countries served these until it was withdrawn: every path, /v3.1 and /v5 alike, now redirects to a deprecation notice, and its successor wants an account and an API key.

Google News RSS, some “511” traffic-camera indexes and a few other feeds send no Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, so a browser cannot read them directly; these public relays fetch the document server-side and re-serve it with the header. What a relay sees is the URL being requested (a public feed address) and the connection itself; no account, no coordinates and no personal data are ever sent through one. All four are raced with an 8-second deadline each and the losers are aborted, so one that is down or slow cannot hold the page. ⚠ THEY ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE PER TARGET, and that is measured rather than assumed: on this build Google served the en-US news edition through corsproxy.io in 5 ms and answered the SAME proxy with its “Sorry…” bot page (503) for the ja-JP edition — which is why the Japanese feed was blank until a fourth relay was added.
