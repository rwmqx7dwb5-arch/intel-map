 *  IntMap · HISTORICAL CITY NAMES — window.IntMapHistCities   (#R427)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  「現在は国名ラベルに関してはChronosに対応していますが、都市名ラベルも同じ要領で対応する
 *    ように。ヴォルゴグラードなど。できる限り多くの、地名の変わった経験のある都市に対応して。
 *    江戸なんかも。数百以上に。」
 *
 *  The COUNTRY labels have travelled in time since #R94k: js/history.js `histId` swaps a country's
 *  name and flag for the era's, and js/time-borders.js draws them (imtb-lbl). This is the same idea
 *  one level down — Volgograd is Stalingrad in 1942, Tokyo is Edo in 1867, Saint Petersburg is
 *  Leningrad in 1960 — and the record is data/hist-cities.json, built from scripts/histcities/.
 *
 *  ══ ⚠⚠⚠ HOW A TILE LABEL IS RENAMED WITHOUT A SECOND LAYER ═════════════════════════════════════
 *  The settlement labels are OpenMapTiles features (`ofm-city`, source-layer `place`), so there is
 *  no property this app can write on them. The obvious answer — draw curated points on top and hide
 *  the tile's own — costs two things it should not: the label moves off the position the tile chose,
 *  and hiding the original still needs a name match, so the hard part is not avoided.
 *
 *  ⚠ SO THE LAYER'S OWN `text-field` IS REWRITTEN. The expression this file builds is a `match` on
 *  the feature's name whose default is the ordinary language expression, so a city in the table is
 *  drawn with its era name AT THE TILE'S OWN POSITION, with the tile's own collision behaviour and
 *  zoom ladder, and every other label on Earth is completely untouched. A `match` compiles to a hash
 *  lookup, so the cost does not grow with the size of the table.
 *
 *  ⚠ TWO MATCHES, NESTED, because the tile may carry the spelling in either field: `name:en` is
 *  tried first and `name` (the local form) second. Every key of a city is in BOTH, and
 *  scripts/build-hist-cities.mjs proves no two cities share a key — a `match` with a repeated label
 *  fails MapLibre's style validation outright («Branch labels must be unique»), which would make
 *  addLayer throw and take the whole label stack with it (#R211 measured exactly that).
 *
 *  ══ ⚠⚠⚠ AND A SPELLING IS NOT AN IDENTITY (#R521) ══════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  Until #R521 the match above WAS the whole rule, and a reader travelling to 1950 watched 高知市
 *  become コーチン. The row is correct — Kochi in Kerala was Cochin until 1996 — and so was every
 *  gate: the expression simply had nothing in it that could tell one Kochi from another, so every
 *  city on Earth sharing a spelling with one of the record's 1 034 keys was in scope. Kirov in
 *  Kaluga oblast would have become Vyatka; Linden, New Jersey would have become Mackenzie.
 *
 *  ⚠ SO EVERY BRANCH IS NOW GUARDED BY POSITION. The value of a branch is not the era name but a
 *  `case`: take the era name only if MapLibre's `distance` expression puts this feature within the
 *  row's guard radius of the row's coordinate, and otherwise fall through to the label the tile
 *  would have had. The radius is not typed by hand — scripts/build-hist-cities.mjs derives it as
 *  half the distance to the nearest settlement on Earth answering to the same spelling under its
 *  own name, capped at 20 km — so no row can be given a radius that reaches its own namesake.
 *
 *  ⚠ `distance` IS EVALUATED IN THE WORKER, WHERE THE GEOMETRY IS. Symbol layout calls
 *  `getValueAndResolveTokens('text-field', evaluationFeature, canonical, …)` with
 *  `evaluationFeature.geometry` already loaded, which is the one condition MapLibre's Distance
 *  expression needs; without geometry or a canonical tile id it returns NaN, and `['<=', NaN, r]`
 *  is false — so the failure direction is «the modern name», never «the wrong city's history».
 *
 *  ⚠ AND THE FALLTHROUGHS ARE `let` BINDINGS, not copies. A branch that fails its guard has to
 *  fall back to the OTHER match (and that one to the base expression), and writing those out per
 *  branch would repeat the base expression 1 034 times inside one layout property. `['let', …]`
 *  binds each once; the branch says `['var', …]`.
 *
 *  ══ WHEN IT APPLIES ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  Whenever the master clock is NOT live. ⚠ NOT gated on `IntMapTimeBorders.active()`, which is what
 *  the modern COUNTRY labels hide on: that flag is false for 2020 and later because CShapes ends in
 *  2019, and a city renamed in 2022 (Nur-Sultan → Astana) has nothing to do with the limits of a
 *  border dataset. A name is a fact about a year; this asks the clock about the year.
 *
 *  ⚠ AND ONLY ON `ofm-city`, whose filter is `class in [city, town]`. ⚠ (#R521) That filter used
 *  to be load-bearing — several rows' written exemptions rested on «a district of Madrid is not in
 *  this layer» — and it is not any more: the guard radius answers those cases by arithmetic, and
 *  scripts/build-hist-cities.mjs no longer accepts a reason of that shape. What the filter still
 *  buys is that `cities500`'s population floor of 500 is comfortably below anything OSM tags
 *  `place=city|town`, so the evidence covers what the layer draws.
