     「あるズームで問答無用に全表示・全非表示になるのをやめる」

     The old gate was a `step`: at z15 every tier-2 POI in view appeared at once, at z16 every
     tier-3, at z17 everything. Four zoom levels where the map changes wholesale — which is what
     the report describes, and it is a property of `step`, not of the data.

     Two changes make it gradual:
       · each feature carries a deterministic offset in [0, 0.9) derived from the tile's own
         `rank`, so the members of one tier no longer share a single threshold;
       · the ladder advances by about 0.6 per zoom instead of 1, so each step admits only a
         FRACTION of a tier and a tier takes roughly two zoom levels to finish arriving.
     Same features, same order (the sort key is untouched) — they simply come in gradually, and
     deterministically, so panning back does not reshuffle them.

     ⚠⚠ AND THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE MUST BE A `step`, NOT AN `interpolate`. MapLibre allows `zoom`
     inside a FILTER only in a `step`: a filter is evaluated once per integer zoom bucket, and an
     `interpolate` there fails style validation, which makes addLayer THROW — so the whole label
     stack failed to add. The first version of this used one, and tests/smoke's "no critical
     console.error from the app itself" caught it. Fractional stops would be pointless here for
     the same reason (the note above says so): the ladder is integer, and the smoothing comes from
     the per-feature offset instead. */

         「地方行政区分も地名ラベルをつけるように。（例：日本の都道府県、アメリカ・ドイツ・オーストラリア
           の州、中国の省など。）」

         The app has drawn state/province BORDERS since #R32 and has never drawn their NAMES. Same
         `place` source-layer as the settlements above; the classes are `state` and `province`, which
         MEASURED over the live tiles carry exactly the units named in the request — 41 Japanese
         prefectures (class `province`, rank 5), 50 US states (`state`, rank 1), the Chinese provinces
         (`state`, rank 2), the German Länder and Australian states (`state`, rank 3) — each with the
         same `name:xx` fields every other label here localises through.

         ⚠ `rank` IS NOT A SEQUENCE NUMBER HERE. #R187 measured that `poi.rank` is one (a flat 72, 72,
         71 … histogram) and stopped gating on it. For state/province it is the opposite: the measured
         values group by SIZE across the whole planet — 1 for US states, 2 for Chinese provinces and
         Canadian provinces, 3 for German/Australian/Spanish/Italian regions, 4 for Russian oblasts,
         5 for Japanese prefectures, 6 for the smallest units — so it is exactly the "how far out is
         this thing still worth naming" ordering a zoom ladder wants. A unit appears when it is big
         enough on screen to hold its name, which is why the ladder is by rank and not by country.

         maxzoom 9: past that the label point is the unit's centroid sitting in the middle of streets
         that have their own names, and the region it belongs to is no longer the question being asked.
         ⚠ The order it is ADDED in here decides nothing: js/app-body.js's label STACK is re-asserted on
         idle and styledata, and that list is where ofm-admin1 is placed below ofm-city — so a crowded
         view resolves in the city's favour.
         ⚠ (#R201) IT IS IN THE LABEL-CLICK / HOVER LISTS. This note used to say the opposite, and the
         reply to it was 「クリック可能ではない！ほかの地名ラベルと違う挙動にするな！」. A label that looks like
         every other place label and answers nothing is not a smaller feature, it is a broken one — so
         js/map-ui.js now wires ofm-admin1 exactly the way it wires ofm-city (cursor, popup, outline). */
      /* ⚠ THE BREAKPOINTS ARE INTEGERS, AND THAT IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE. `['zoom']` inside a FILTER is
         re-evaluated only at INTEGER zooms — the app's own #R186 note says so about the POI gate, and
         this ladder was written with fractional stops (3.2 / 3.8 / 4.6 / 5.3 / 6.0 / 6.8) anyway.
         MEASURED consequence: Australia's states are rank 3, so they claimed to appear at z4.6, and at
         z4.6 the filter is evaluated at zoom 4, where the threshold is still 2 — six states present in
         the tiles and NOT ONE drawn, at exactly the zoom you look at Australia. Germany (also rank 3)
         hid the bug because you look at Germany at z5+, where floor(z) happens to agree.
         Integer stops mean the ladder does what it reads as.
         ⚠ AND rank 3 HAS TO ENTER AT z4, NOT z5. Measured again after the first fix: at z5 Australia
         no longer fits on screen, so only the one state whose label point is still in view gets drawn
         (South Australia, 1 of 6). The zoom at which you look at Australia IS z4 — the same z4 that
         already draws US states — and rank does not mean area here (Australia's states are far larger
         than the German Länder that share rank 3), so a ladder that separates them by zoom separates
         them by nothing. Each stop is pinned to a zoom verified by rendering: z4 → ranks 1-3, US (20),
         China (10), Brazil (16), India, Germany, Australia; z5 → rank 4, Russia (7); z6 → rank 5, the

         was simply never re-read against it.
         ⚠ AND THREE MORE CLASSES WERE NEVER NAMED AT ALL. Measured on the live tiles
         (tiles.openfreemap.org/planet, 2026-08 build, one z14 tile each):
             Osaka  z14   neighbourhood 452,  suburb   5   (錦町, 淀川区)

             Paris  z14   neighbourhood   5,  quarter  8,  suburb 23   (Reuilly, Bercy)
             Madison z14  neighbourhood  17,  quarter  1   (Vilas, Downtown)
         So 町名・丁目・Kiez・Quartier — the whole tier the report is about — were absent everywhere,
         and it is one list for the planet, which is what 「世界共通」 asks for. `isolated_dwelling` and

         ⚠ THE LADDER EXISTS SO THAT NOTHING DRAWN TODAY MOVES. The three classes this layer already
         admits are tier 1 and stay ungated from minzoom 7 — byte-for-byte their present behaviour. The
         new ones enter above them, and the tiles agree with the ladder rather than fight it: measured,
         `place` carries suburb from z12 and neighbourhood/quarter/borough only in the z14 tiles, so a
         stop below that would admit nothing anyway.
         ⚠ `symbol-sort-key` IS WHAT MAKES 452 LABELS IN ONE TILE READABLE. Collision resolves in favour
         of the coarser unit first and, inside a tier, of the tile's own `rank` — the same rule

         「Base map & labelsに、地点の名前も追加して。（例：地名などではなく、店舗名や施設名など）」

         Settlement names come from the `place` layer above and water/terrain names from `waterway`,
         `water_name` and `mountain_peak`. Shops, restaurants, stations, hospitals, schools, museums
         and hotels are none of those — in the OpenMapTiles schema they are the `poi` layer, which
         the app has simply never drawn. Same source, same tiles, same fonts; nothing new is fetched.

         TWO THINGS ABOUT `poi` THAT DECIDE THE SHAPE OF THIS LAYER:
           · It starts at z14. Below that the tiles carry no POIs at all, so a lower minzoom would
             not show more, it would only ask the renderer to look.
           · It is DENSE — a city block can hold dozens. OpenMapTiles already answers that with
             `rank`, its own per-tile importance ordering (1 = the one to keep). So the filter opens
             the rank window as the zoom goes in, and `symbol-sort-key` hands the same ordering to
             the collision test, which means the label that survives a crowded corner is the one the
             tile itself considers most significant rather than whichever came first in the buffer.
             ⚠ `["zoom"]` inside a FILTER is only re-evaluated at integer zooms — that is exactly
             what a per-tile rank window wants, so it is used deliberately here and nowhere else.
         A dot marks the point itself: the text is offset off the feature, and without the dot the
         name would float with nothing under it. */
      /* ══ (#R187) WHAT KIND OF PLACE IT IS DECIDES WHETHER IT IS DRAWN ═══════════════════════════
         「（追記：店以外もいろいろ地点を追加して。）」

         #R186 gated this layer on OpenMapTiles' `rank`, on the belief that rank is a per-tile
         IMPORTANCE ordering. MEASURED over the tiles for central Tokyo at z16, it is not: the rank
         histogram is flat — 72, 72, 71, 71, 71 … — i.e. rank is a sequence number, not a score. So the
         window `rank ≤ 40` was an arbitrary slice, and of the 12,134 POIs in view it admitted 2,769,
         of which the two largest groups were **shop (723) and bus stops (372)** while restaurants fell
         from 1,903 to 41. What survived collision on screen was 74 labels: 24 bus stops and 14 shops,
         with one bank, one bakery, one school. Convenience stores and bus stops — which is the report.

         The window is therefore on the one field that DOES say what a place is: `class`. Four tiers,
         opened by zoom, so a hospital, a university, a station, a museum or a park appears as soon as
         the layer does, ordinary shops and restaurants join a zoom later, and street furniture (bus
         stops, entrances, benches, bollards) comes last instead of first. Nothing is removed — every
         class the tiles carry is still reachable, just no longer ahead of the landmarks.

         The same expression is the `symbol-sort-key`, so the collision test resolves a crowded corner
         the same way: the hospital keeps its label and the vending machine loses it. `rank` stays as
         the tie-break WITHIN a tier, which is the one job the flat sequence is fit for. */
      /* (#R211) minzoom 14 → 12: tier 1 is what a person navigates by (a hospital, a station, an
         airport), and it was not drawn at the zoom where you are looking for one. The gate above

       the modern borders above CShapes' last year (2019, js/time-borders.js), while the subdivision
       record runs to today. Between those, one flag would have shown `ofm-admin1` AND `imta-lbl` at
