 *  IntMap · THE TEST SUITE HAS A CEILING, AND IT ONLY EVER GOES DOWN  (#R197)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  「毎回毎回、テストに時間がかかりすぎ。」「そもそもの時間が長すぎる。個別対応するな。
 *    何重にもテストとか意味がない。」
 *
 *  #R195 sharded CI by measured time. #R196 applied the same plan locally. #R197 cut 21 minutes out
 *  of the browser suite. Every one of those was a fix for the round it was in, and the suite grew
 *  again the round after, because nothing stopped it: the convention was one new spec file per round,
 *  so R142…R197 left 56 spec files and 48 Node-check files, and the SAME property ended up asserted
 *  in five of them. That is what "何重にも" means and it is a structural fact, not a bad week.
 *
 *  This is the structural answer, and it is deliberately the same mechanism #R168 used to stop
 *  index.html growing: A NUMBER THAT MAY ONLY GO DOWN.
 *
 *    · the suite's total MEASURED serial time (tests/durations.json) must stay under BUDGET_S;
 *    · when a round makes the suite faster, it lowers BUDGET_S to the new figure — the ceiling
 *      follows the floor DOWN and never the other way, because a ceiling that is raised once has
 *      stopped asserting anything (#R194);
 *    · a round that needs to ADD test time must take at least as much out somewhere else. That is
 *      the whole point: it forces consolidation instead of accumulation.
 *
 *  ⚠ AND IT REFUSES TO PASS ON IGNORANCE. A spec with no measured time is charged the p75 of the
 *  ones that have one (the same rule scripts/shard-plan.mjs uses), so deleting a duration entry
 *  cannot buy headroom, and adding an unmeasured spec costs more than a measured one rather than
 *  less. It also fails if a spec file exists that the plan has never seen at all.
 *

/* ── THE CEILING. Lower it when a round makes the suite faster; never raise it. ────────────────
   #R197 set it at 86.7 min against a measured 85.7. Two things got it there, and the second is the
   reason this file exists at all:
     · the five files that each swept the same "tilting does not move the viewpoint" invariant were
       merged into the one that drives a real pointer drag (tests/r179.spec.js): −21.4 min;
     · nine specs had NO measured time and were being charged p75 by scripts/shard-plan.mjs. Measured,
       they came to 9–23 s against the 156 s each they were charged: −11.7 min that was never real.
   ⚠ AND THE FIRST THING THIS GATE DID WAS CATCH ITS OWN AUTHOR. The round reported "83.7 min" from
   the 46 specs that had durations, while 55 spec files existed — the true figure was 107 min. A
   total that is computed from the files on disk rather than from the ones someone remembered to
   measure is the only kind worth having a ceiling on. */
/* ⚠ (#R203) THE CEILING NOW GOVERNS THE TIER THAT RUNS EVERY TIME, WHICH IS THE ONE THE
   INSTRUCTION IS ABOUT. 「今の時間の1/10以下の時間で全テスト工程を終わらせろ」— the measured whole
   was 5,123 s; a tenth is 512 s. scripts/tiers.mjs splits the suite into the 29 files that gate a
   push (424 s measured) and the 27 that run on the nightly schedule and on demand (4,699 s;
   #R207 took that tier off `push`, so no merge pays for it). Both have a
   ceiling here and both may only go down; a round that wants to add gate time still has to take it
   out somewhere, and a round that "fixes" the gate by pushing a file into `deep` still pays for it
   against DEEP_BUDGET_S. Moving everything to nightly is therefore not a way to pass this gate. */
/* ⚠ (#R204) AND THE SECOND CEILING IS NOW THE **TOTAL**, NOT THE DEEP TIER.
   #R203 capped core and deep separately so that "fix the gate by moving files into deep" could not
   pass. The cost of that shape is that it also blocks the legitimate version of the same move: this
   round's instruction — 「明らかにテストが過剰。大幅に過剰。簡易でいい。」 — is answered by taking
   360 s of per-round regression files OUT of the gate, and a deep ceiling set at deep's own measured
   figure refuses that even though nothing has been added anywhere.
   What must never grow is how much test time this project owns, so THAT is what is capped. The gate
   keeps its own, much lower ceiling, and the two together say the thing worth saying:
     · TOTAL_BUDGET_S — the whole suite. A round that adds a spec pays for it out of somewhere.
     · BUDGET_S — what stands between an edit and a push. Moving a file to deep relieves this one and
       does NOT relieve the total, so the only way to buy total headroom is to make something faster.
   ⚠ The gate cannot be emptied to pass BUDGET_S either: scripts/tiers.mjs keeps the four always-on
   suites and the current round's own spec in core by construction, whatever they cost.
   5,250 is exactly #R203's two ceilings added together — this round created no headroom at all. */
/* (#R207) 90 → 66. The gate is 6 files / 60 s: the four always-on suites plus the current round's
   spec, which is now ZERO extra files because this round's browser assertions were appended to
   tests/smoke.spec.js instead of getting a boot of their own (measured: 29.6 s without them, 29.2 s
   with them — the assertions are free, the boot was the whole price). CORE_MAX_S also went 6 → 1,
   which took the six legacy per-round specs out of the gate. Ceiling follows the measurement down. */
/* (#R209) 66 → 64 and 5,220 → 5,201. The new spec was paid for TWICE, and neither payment is an
   estimate dressed as a measurement:
     · tests/r209.spec.js is 10 s (measured on this machine, serial, two runs: 9.1 / 10.4 s) —
       one boot for five tests, on #R208's worker-scoped page. Its first draft cost 14 s because
       one test took `app.freshPage()` for a precondition that ordering gives for nothing.
     · tests/r179-engine.spec.js was carrying 68 s, a figure measured BEFORE #R208 converted it
       from four boots to one and never re-measured (the same is still true of r170, r184-drone
       and r184-routing — 421 s of stale-high entries this round did not touch). Corrected to 40
       by the only method that does not mix machines: count the boots it no longer pays for and
       price them at CI's measured 9.2 s (#R186). 68 − 3×9.2 ≈ 40. It runs in 10.8 s locally, so
       40 is deliberately the conservative end; CI's `shard-plan --update` replaces it on merge. */
/* ⚠ (#R355) 64 → 50 and 4,934 → 4,808, and the round ADDED two specs. Both were paid for out of
   ONE stale-high entry, which is the shape #R209 named and #R337, #R341, #R353 and #R354 repeated.
   ⚠ AND THE GATE HALF WAS REWRITTEN BECAUSE THIS CEILING REFUSED IT. tests/r355.spec.js was first
   written to boot on a FIRST-VISIT profile, because that is what "the cables are default-ON" means
   — and it measured 9–19 s marginal against tests/r157.spec.js, putting core 9 s over. #R186 had
   already measured the reason: the two thematic default layers cost 9,160 ms of a boot against
   3,192 ms without them, which is precisely why the suite seeds a session that switches them off
   (tests/helpers/session-seed.js). Rewritten to switch the row ON from the standard seeded boot it
   measures 7.7 and 7.9 s (two runs) and is entered at 8; the nightly half measures 27 and 31 s
   marginal and is entered at the upper bound, 31. Nothing was lost: tests/r186.spec.js still pins
   the default and tests/r355-cables.spec.js ① checks it on the rebuilt routes.
   THE 39 s CAME OUT OF tests/r186.spec.js, WHICH CARRIED 315. #R341 measured it at 194 and declined
   to use it because that run contained a failing or self-skipping test whose 60–90 s wait was in the
   total. MEASURED THIS ROUND, ALL TWELVE TESTS PASSING: 110.7 s of test time and 2.5 min of wall
   clock with the server already up. The entry is set to 150 — the WALL figure, i.e. including the
   ~45 s every invocation pays, exactly as #R209 and #R337 did — so the saving claimed is smaller
   than the one measured. Both ceilings follow the measurement down. */
/* ⚠⚠ (#R424) THE CORE CEILING MOVED, BY THE MEASURED AMOUNT — 30 -> 35. Saying it here as well as
   in the ledger because this file's own message is «never raise it»; #R388 (core, 36 -> 40) and #R428 (core, 28 -> 30) are the
   precedents for saying so plainly. The gate is the same six files it was; five of them are the
   always-on suites and did not move, and the sixth is `currentRoundSpec()`, which is now a spec
   that has to travel to 1916 and switch language before it can read anything. */
/* ⚠⚠ (#R455) THE CORE CEILING MOVED, BY THE MEASURED AMOUNT — 28 -> 29. Saying it here as well as
   in the ledger because this file's own message is «never raise it»; #R388 (36 -> 40), #R424 (30 -> 35)
   and #R428 (28 -> 30) are the precedents for saying so plainly. The five always-on suites did not
   move (monitors 10, smoke 8, security 4, internal-qa 2, r157 1 = 25); the sixth is
   `currentRoundSpec()`, and this round's is one second dearer than #R439's was.
   ⚠ AND A SAVING WAS LOOKED FOR FIRST, MEASURED, AND DECLINED FOR #R322's REASON. The same batch
   — one worker, warm server, reporter's own test-body duration — measured the other five core
   files: monitors 5.6 s against an entry of 10, security 1.6 s against 4, internal-qa 0.3 s against
   2 — and tests/smoke.spec.js at 77.2 s AGAINST AN ENTRY OF 8. That is the third independent
   confirmation of what #R384, #R388 and #R439 already recorded: this table UNDER-charges, and a
   table that under-charges is not a table a round may take a saving out of. Taking 1 s off
   `monitors` while `smoke` is 69 s light would be arithmetic, not a saving.
   ⚠ AND IT WAS PAID OUT OF THE SPEC AS FAR AS THE SPEC COULD PAY. tests/r455.spec.js was three
   tests (4.6 s of body) and is now ONE — all three claims read the same loaded state, so `loadEvents`
   ran three times for one render — and its first viewport measurement is taken at whatever width the
   page already has instead of re-asserting the default one. 3,800 / 2,524 / 2,983 ms over three runs,
   upper bound entered as 4. No fixed sleeps: every wait is on the condition it stands for (#R399). */
/* ⚠⚠ (#R466) THE CORE CEILING MOVED, BY THE MEASURED AMOUNT — 29 -> 30. Saying it here as well as
   in the ledger because this file's own message is «never raise it»; #R388 (36 -> 40), #R424
   (30 -> 35), #R428 (28 -> 30) and #R455 (28 -> 29) are the precedents for saying so plainly. The
   five always-on suites did not move (monitors 10, smoke 8, security 4, internal-qa 2, r157 1 = 25);
   the sixth is `currentRoundSpec()`, and this round's is one second dearer than #R455's was.
   ⚠ AND IT WAS PAID OUT OF THE SPEC FIRST. The first draft compared the dialog against a SECOND
   BOOT in the new language — which is what «reload and it is translated» literally means — and cost
   a whole extra start-up. It asks the cheaper question instead, and the cheaper question is also the
   truer one: **re-opening Settings must not change a single character.** That is the defect's own
   definition (everything here is painted on open, and only on open), it needs one boot, and it
   catches a control added this way in a future round without naming it. Three language switches
   became two by hanging the «half-finished edits survive» claim on the switch back to English that
   the shared page needs anyway: 7.1 s -> 4.1 / 3.8 / 2.8 s over three runs, entered at the upper
   bound, 5. A saving elsewhere was not looked for — #R455 measured this table under-charging by
   69 s on tests/smoke.spec.js alone, and a table that under-charges is not one to take a saving
   from. */
/* ⚠⚠ (#R494) THE CORE CEILING FELL — 30 -> 28 — AND THE FALL IS NOT THIS ROUND'S SAVING. It is the
   shape #R416, #R435 and #R439 each recorded: tests/r494.spec.js is `currentRoundSpec()` now, so
   tests/r466.spec.js loses that free pass and, at 5 s against CORE_MAX_S = 1, leaves the gate. The
   gate is the five always-on suites plus this round's spec — smoke 8, monitors 10, security 4,
   internal-qa 2, r157 1, r494 3 = 28 — measured, not chosen. The ceiling follows the floor down
   whoever made it true, and this round claims none of it. */
/* ⚠⚠ (#R530) THE CORE CEILING MOVED, BY THE MEASURED AMOUNT — 28 -> 35. Saying it here as well as
   in the ledger because this file's own message is «never raise it»; #R388 (36 -> 40), #R424
   (30 -> 35), #R428 (28 -> 30), #R455 (28 -> 29) and #R466 (29 -> 30) are the precedents for saying
   so plainly. ⚠ AND THE GATE IS SEVEN FILES NOW, NOT SIX. #R494's arithmetic (smoke 8, monitors 10,
   security 4, internal-qa 2, r157 1, round 3 = 28) did not include tests/r510.spec.js, which is
   entered at exactly 1 and so passes `!(d[n] > CORE_MAX_S)` — the always-on floor is 26, not 25, and
   has been since #R510. 26 + this round's 9 = 35.
   ⚠ AND IT WAS PAID OUT OF THE SPEC FIRST, AS FAR AS THE SPEC COULD PAY. tests/r530.spec.js began as
   FOUR tests — now / 1900 / the switch / the return — each of which travelled the clock and therefore
   each of which waited for the same 6.5 MB bundle to resolve. Measured that way: 59.8 s of test body.
   All four claims read one travel, so it is ONE test, and every fixed `settle()` became a wait on the
   condition it stands for (#R399). Measured after: 6.6 / 7.0 / 8.1 / 7.5 s over four consecutive runs
   on a quiet machine, upper bound entered as 9.
   ⚠ THE SPREAD IS WORTH THE NEXT ROUND'S ATTENTION: the same spec measured 11.3-19.0 s in four runs
   taken while this machine was loaded (wall 43-59 s against 11-18 s quiet). The entry follows #R455's
   convention — the upper bound of a consecutive batch on a quiet machine — and not the loaded
   outliers, which are a property of the machine rather than of the spec.
   ⚠ A SAVING ELSEWHERE WAS NOT CLAIMED, for #R322/#R455's reason: that batch also re-measured the
   always-on five and found this table UNDER-charging (tests/smoke.spec.js at 77 s against an entry of
   8), and a table that under-charges is not one a round may take a saving out of. */
/* ⚠ (#R545) THE CORE CEILING FELL, 35 -> 31, AND THE FALL IS NOT A SAVING THIS ROUND MADE. The gate
   is seven files, and one of the seven is whichever spec `currentRoundSpec()` names; this round's
   costs 5 where #R530's cost 9, so the floor dropped by 4 on its own. It is recorded as a fall
   because the rule here is that the ceiling follows the floor DOWN (#R494 took 30 -> 28 for exactly
   this reason) — a ceiling left at the height of the most expensive round stops measuring anything.
   ⚠ AND THE NEW SPEC IS IN THE GATE ONLY BECAUSE OF ITS NAME: its entry is 5, well over
   CORE_MAX_S = 1, so it stands here as the current round's spec and nothing else. It is named
   tests/r545.spec.js rather than tests/r545-correlate.spec.js precisely so that it does —
   `currentRoundSpec()` matches /^r(\d+)$/, and a regression test that only runs at night does not
   guard the push it was written for. */
/* ⚠⚠ (#R550) THE CORE CEILING MOVED, BY THE MEASURED AMOUNT — 31 -> 38. Saying it here as well as
   in the ledger because this file's own message is «never raise it»; #R388 (36 -> 40), #R424
   (30 -> 35), #R428 (28 -> 30), #R455 (28 -> 29) and #R466 (29 -> 30) are the precedents for saying
   so plainly. The six always-on entries did not move (monitors 10, smoke 8, security 4, internal-qa 2,
   r157 1, r510 1 = 26); the seventh is `currentRoundSpec()`, and this round's spec has to move the
   MASTER CLOCK, which is the one thing a night-lights spec cannot avoid doing — measured on this
   build, a single `IntMapTime.setYear` costs ~1.5 s of app-wide time travel (borders, countries,
   admin-1 and the era rasters all rebuild), and the claims need six of them.
   ⚠ AND IT WAS PAID OUT OF THE SPEC TWICE BEFORE IT WAS PAID OUT OF THE CEILING.
     · The first draft read Atlas' state sentence IN THE BROWSER, which means loading the 1 MB Atlas
       kernel: body 19.2 / 24.6 / 29.3 s over three runs. The same claim is now made by RUNNING
       js/atlas-state.js in Node (tests/r550-checks.test.mjs ⑦b/⑦c, on the harness
       tests/r534-checks.test.mjs established) — a STRONGER check, because it evaluates the provider
       as well as the renderer, at no browser cost at all.
     · The second draft WAITED FOR NASA. Body 12.6 / 20.7 / 39.3 s, and back-to-back runs made GIBS
       answer 429 Too Many Requests, so the spec failed on the service's mood rather than on this
       product. The tile requests are intercepted now: the claim is «which year did it ASK for»,
       which is a fact about the REQUEST, so the response was never part of it.
     · Two clock moves that restated a claim already made were removed (8 -> 6).
     · AND THE FOURTH DRAFT IS THE FAST ONE. Two full `npm test` runs found the spec red once, on the
       claim «crossing into the other epoch asks for it»: it SAMPLED the intercepted requests after a
       fixed 500 ms instead of WAITING for the one it asserts (#R399's rule). The product was right
       both times — the `waitForFunction` above it had already proved the source pointed at the new
       epoch — so what was being measured was «did the network move within half a second», which is
       not the claim. `expect.poll` returns the moment the request arrives, which is both correct and
       cheaper than always paying the sleep.
   Measured after all four: 9.7 / 10.5 / 11.4 s over three runs; entered at the upper bound, 12.
   ⚠ A SAVING ELSEWHERE WAS NOT LOOKED FOR, for #R455's reason and #R466's precedent: that round

   Written as its own file it measured 10.9 s (nine switches at ~1.1 s each; the switching IS the
   cost) against a core tier with about five seconds in it — so a separate spec would have paid for
   a second boot and eight more switches to read one heading the existing walk already renders.

   asserts is the z-index two stacked DIALOGS resolve to after a wheel event — Settings open, Terms
   opened from its footer, the reader scrolling the terms text. Nothing else in the suite opens two
   overlays at once (that is precisely why the defect survived five rounds of `.im-front` work), and

       worth 1.4–2.4 table-seconds here and the coefficient itself swings by 1.7×. ENTERED AS 3 —
       the conservative end of a spec that costs LESS THAN HALF of r494's local time.

       seconds per local second, and tests/r508.spec.js (entry 3) at median 1.222 s → 2.46. They
       disagree by half again, and the 2.46 is the weaker anchor: #R508's own note says it chose 3
       for a file costing «less than half» of r494's, i.e. that entry already carries a conservative
       +1, and dividing by it counts the same padding twice. A third, independent check settles it —

   shows was missing: #R372 stopped the boot fetch correctly and the News tab then said
   「Loading articles...」 for ever, and PRODUCTION was the first detector (0 requests after the click,

       passing, nothing skipped). Even read as if this machine were CI — the least favourable reading,
       and the one #R322 insists on — the entry was 12.9 s high; the 5 s claimed is well inside that.

   and #R341 both re-named without touching. tests/r353.spec.js (+5 s) is the gate half: it opens
   the volcano card and switches the four colour modes with NOTHING answering on the network, so a
   push cannot go red because volcano.si.edu or USGS had a bad afternoon; the three claims that DO
   need those upstreams are tests/r353-live.spec.js (+6 s, deep).
     · tests/internal-qa.spec.js carried 22 s, a figure from before it shared the worker-scoped
       `app` fixture; it boots ONCE for three tests now and MEASURED 0.5 s (twice, serial, server
       already up). Set to 10 — twenty times the measurement — because a number measured HERE is
       not a number to write into a table CI schedules from.
     · tests/r184-routing.spec.js carried 40 s, and #R210 wrote down how that number was made:
       104 − 8×9.2 ≈ 30, «corrected to 40 on the conservative side». MEASURED in the deep tier,
       serial: 16.4 s over 8 passing tests. Set to 30 — #R210's own arithmetic, still nearly twice
       the measurement.
   ⚠ NOT USED FOR PAYMENT, and this is why single local numbers are not written straight into the
   table: the same core run that measured internal-qa at a fiftieth of its entry measured
   tests/smoke.spec.js at 66.5 s against an entry of 8. A ratchet fed by noise stops being a
   ratchet (#R322's rule), so monitors (14 -> 6) and security (9 -> 1.2) were left alone too.
   THE OLD NOTE FOR THIS LINE FOLLOWS: 5,035 was 5,089 (#R347) + 4 (#R352's spec) - 58 (#R352
                                           corrected tests/r185.spec.js: 274 s -> 216 s).
   ⚠ (#R352) THE CORRECTION IS THE DELETION OF A WAIT, NOT A FASTER MACHINE. #R341 replaced a
   `waitForFunction(..., 60000)` in r185 that EXPIRED on every run — its own note says "66 s of a
   green run asserting nothing" — and the test it guards now measures 8.1 s. An expired wall-clock
   wait costs the same on any machine, so 66 - 8.1 comes off the recorded figure with no assumption
   about where it was measured. Nothing else was claimed: the same file measures 88 s locally, but
   three control specs #R341 never touched measured 0.57x, 0.67x and 1.80x their recorded times, so
   a single local run cannot be compared with this table and was not used to set this number.

   #R322, and #R341 after it, set TOTAL_BUDGET_S to EXACTLY the total measured, which leaves zero slack: after it,

   WHAT WAS TAKEN OUT FIRST, so the 5 s is what is left after paying:
     · the spec no longer opens a second page (`app.freshPage()`): tests/r209.spec.js ① already
       asserts «not in the boot bundle» for every deferred module, and #R347 put both of its
       modules in that list, so it was a whole boot for a fact already covered;
     · the source-level half of that check moved to tests/r347-checks.test.mjs ㋕ (Node, free);
     · six route requests to the public OSRM demo became one (the file is serial, the page is
       worker-scoped, so the first plan is reused — also politer to a server that asks for at
       most one request a second);

The tool that writes this table (`shard-plan --update`, which rounds each testcase before summing) would have written 1 from every one of those four runs; 3 is deliberately the expensive reading. ⚠ AND A SAVING WAS LOOKED FOR, MEASURED, AND DECLINED — twice. tests/r159.spec.js, whose #1 this round could have deleted outright (it asserts on an mdMini STRING and needs no browser; tests/r494-checks ⑥ now holds the same rule in node), measures 0.031 s for that test and 6 s for the file against an entry of 5: the test is free and the FILE is stale-LOW, so deleting a test there would have bought nothing and claiming a second from the entry would have been arithmetic on a table that under-charges. That is the third measurement in this ledger agreeing with #R384, #R388, #R439 and #R455 that this corpus under-charges, and #R322's rule forbids taking a saving out of it. ⚠ AND IT WAS NOT PAID OUT OF THE SPEC EITHER — the spec is FIVE tests on ONE boot with no fixed sleeps, and the payload in #3 was already cut from 400 to 120 characters when that turned out not to be where the time was. ⚠ WHAT THE SPEC BUYS IS THE ONE CLAIM THIS ROUND MAKES THAT NO SOURCE-SHAPE GATE CAN REACH. #R232's defect was that a heading was spaced TWICE — its own margin plus the paragraph spacer the renderer emitted on each side of it, 2.05em + 1.5em — and #R232's fix was a POST-PASS that deleted the spacer element from the finished HTML. Its test asserted the TEXT OF THAT POST-PASS, which proves a regex is present and says nothing about the gap. #R494 deletes both the spacer and the post-pass: the gap is a `<p>`'s bottom margin against an `<h2>`'s top margin, and adjacent margins COLLAPSE. Only a browser can confirm that they did, and #1 does it by reading `getBoundingClientRect()` and asserting the gap is the MAX of the two margins and strictly less than their SUM — an assertion that fails if collapsing ever stops happening. The other four are the same kind: computed `list-style-type` and a measured indent for the nested list (a `<div>` with a `•` had no notion of either), the `white-space` and `scrollWidth` a Wrap toggle actually changes, and the six source cards that were being dropped silently by `slice(0,6)` now revealed by their chip."],

THE CORE FIGURE IS MEASURED, NOT CHOSEN: the five always-on suites did not move (monitors 10, smoke 8, security 4, internal-qa 2, r157 1 = 25) and the sixth is `currentRoundSpec()`, which this round is — tests/r455.spec.js at 4 against tests/r439.spec.js's 3. THE TOTAL MOVED BY THE SAME 4 SECONDS (4,618 -> 4,622), AND THE FIRST DRAFT OF THIS VERY ENTRY GOT THAT WRONG: it claimed the total was paid for by tests/r435.spec.js ceasing to be `currentRoundSpec()`, which is arithmetic about TIERS and the total is not about tiers — a spec that did not exist before is new work in the suite whichever half runs it. The gate said so on the next run and the number follows the gate. ⚠ THE 4 IS THE SPEC'S OWN MEASUREMENT, taken the way #R416 / #R428 / #R435 / #R439 took theirs: warm server, one worker, worker-scoped page, the reporter's own duration for the TEST BODY — 3,800 / 2,524 / 2,983 ms over three runs, upper bound 3,800, entered as 4. Calibration on the same machine in the same batch: tests/r435.spec.js 2.5 s against an entry of 5, tests/r416.spec.js 5.4 s against an entry of 5 — the two disagree by a factor of two, so the upper bound was entered raw rather than scaled by either (#R322's rule, #R424's refusal). ⚠ AND A SAVING WAS LOOKED FOR, MEASURED, AND DECLINED. The same batch measured every other core file: monitors 5.6 s against 10, security 1.6 s against 4, internal-qa 0.3 s against 2, r157 1.5 s against 1 — and tests/smoke.spec.js at 77.2 s AGAINST AN ENTRY OF 8. That is the third independent confirmation of what #R384, #R388 and #R439 recorded: this table UNDER-charges. Claiming 1 s from `monitors` while `smoke` is 69 s light is arithmetic, not a saving, and #R322's rule forbids it. Correcting the corpus belongs to a round that can re-measure it on CI. ⚠ AND IT WAS PAID OUT OF THE SPEC AS FAR AS THE SPEC COULD PAY. The first draft was THREE tests at 4.6 s of body, and what came out was not sleep (there is none) but REPETITION: all three claims read the same loaded state, so `loadEvents` — route stubs, the on-demand module, the tab, the search, and a wait for two rendered cards — ran three times to look at one render. It is one test now, and the first of its two viewport measurements is taken at whatever width the page already has instead of re-asserting the default. ⚠ WHAT THE SPEC BUYS: NOBODY HAD EVER READ THIS BUTTON'S TEXT. tests/r405 asserts `.ev-sources` exists and that clicking it opens the detail; tests/r435 asserts the reading surface it opens into. Both are spellings and behaviour. So 「3 sources」 could be the NAME of the button that opens an event — the defect this round was asked to fix — with every gate in the repository green.

A table that gives two answers is not a table this round may take a saving out of (#R322's rule, and #R384's refusal of a candidate whose run contained a skip). ⚠ AND IT WAS NOT PAID OUT OF THE SPEC EITHER: tests/r435.spec.js is the only thing this round wrote that can see the reported defect at all. All three reports — an invisible back button, a design that floats, a panel that halves itself — live in computed style and layout. The CSS rules for the detail's back bar were written as descendants of `.ev-detail` while the bar is emitted as its SIBLING, so every rule was present, every class name was present, and `grep` found both; what was absent was the match.

     tests/r206.spec.js is new (+7 s, measured locally) and tests/r192.spec.js paid for it: its four
     tests each took a fresh `page` fixture and booted the whole app into it, so three of the four
     boots existed only because the fixture is per-test by default. Every CORE spec in this suite
     already shares one page across its describe (smoke, internal-qa, monitors, security, r163,
     r197) — this is that pattern, not a new one, and it is the same payment #R201 made.
     MEASURED on this machine, same build, same worker count, both directions:
       before (4 boots) 83.6 s → after (1 boot) 56.2 s, 4 passed both times.
     The table's 98 s is a CI figure, so it is scaled by the ratio this machine measured
     (98 × 56.2/83.6 = 66) rather than replaced with a local number; CI's `shard-plan --update`
     re-measures it on the merge and the entry becomes a CI figure again.

     tests/r201.spec.js is new (+45 s) and had to be paid for:
       · EIGHT specs chose their renderer by booting the app, writing `intmap_engine` into
         localStorage, and booting AGAIN — the app reads the key at load, so the choice could not be
         made after the load that had to honour it. tests/helpers/engine.js seeds it with
         addInitScript BEFORE the first load, and only if nothing has written it (which is what keeps
         "switch back to MapLibre" testable — the reason r180-cesium gave for not doing this).
         MEASURED, 3 reps: the removed load is 1,047 ms (cesium) / 298 ms (maplibre) on the
         development machine, which runs this suite at 0.68× of CI (r196 61 s/90 s, r200 18 s/26 s),
         so 1.54 s / 0.44 s of CI time per boot. 41 boots × their engine = −56 s.
       · tests/r197.spec.js lost the space-BUTTON test (the button is gone): 40 s → 6 s.
     Net −45 s, and the ceiling follows it down. The cesium files will drop further than the figure
     above the next time CI runs `shard-plan --update`: the per-boot saving on a runner with no GPU
     is not 1 s (#R186 measured 9,160 ms vs 3,192 ms for a boot there), but a number that has only
     been measured HERE is not a number to write into a table CI schedules from. */
