 *
 *  ══ WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A SECOND TRANSLATION ═══════════════════════════════════════════
 *  #R223 translated 2,100 strings into Traditional Chinese. Simplified Chinese is not a different
 *  translation of those strings — for the overwhelming majority of them it is the SAME sentence in a
 *  different orthography, and a hand-made second copy would start drifting from the first the day
 *  after it shipped. So the Simplified file is DERIVED, the derivation is this file, and
 *  tests/r224-checks.test.mjs re-runs it and fails if the committed output is not what it produces.
 *  A string fixed in ui.zh.js is therefore fixed in both, or the build says so.
 *
 *  ⚠ BUT A CHARACTER MAP ALONE IS NOT SIMPLIFIED CHINESE, which is why 「語彙の置換」 was the answer:
 *  「網路」 converts to 「网路」, a spelling nobody in mainland China writes — it is 「网络」. Same for
 *  資訊/信息, 螢幕/屏幕, 檔案/文件, 預設/默认, 選單/菜单, 視窗/窗口, 伺服器/服务器, 演算法/算法,
 *  資料/数据, 使用者/用户, 解析度/分辨率, 座標/坐标, 公尺/米 … So the WORD table runs FIRST, on the
 *  Traditional text (where the Taiwanese spellings are unambiguous), and the character map second.
 *
 *  ⚠ ONE-TO-MANY IS HANDLED IN THE WORD TABLE, NEVER IN THE CHARACTER MAP. 著 is 着 in mainland
 *  orthography for the aspect marker and for 着色/着陆, but stays 著 in 著名/著作/顯著 — so those
 *  words are pinned before the blanket 著→着 runs. Same shape for 乾 (干燥, but 乾坤 keeps 乾).
 *
 *  RUN:  node scripts/zh-hans.mjs          → rewrites js/locales/ui.zh-hans.js
 *        node scripts/zh-hans.mjs --check  → exits non-zero if the committed file is out of date

   The reading pages (sources.html / science.html) got their Chinese this round, and they are a
   SECOND body of text with the same property #R224 identified for the first: Simplified is not a
   different translation of it, it is the same sentences in a different orthography. So the same
   derivation runs over both, and `--check` covers both — a Traditional string fixed by hand in
   either file is fixed in its Simplified twin, or the build says so.

     A transliteration is not an orthography, so the character map cannot reach it: 西發里亞 and
     威斯特伐利亞 are different SYLLABLE choices for «Westphalia», and converting the characters of
     the first gives 西发里亚 — a spelling a mainland reader has never seen. OpenCC already carries
     the common ones (拿破崙→拿破仑, 蘇伊士→苏伊士, 哥倫布→哥伦布); these are the ones it does not,
     found by reading this round's 262 new Chinese strings against their generated Simplified.
     ⚠ THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE IS TRADITIONAL, like every other row here — the character map runs after
     this table, so a cell states a WORD choice and never an orthography.
     ⚠ AND THE LEFT-HAND SIDE MUST NOT BE A WORD THE UI ALSO USES. 「複製」 is Taiwan's word for
     cloning AND the ordinary word for «copy»: MEASURED, it is on 19 lines of ui.zh.js and 18 of
     them are the Copy button, the copy-coordinates menu item, 「已複製」… A blanket 複製→克隆 would
     have relabelled every one of them «clone». The entry is 複製羊 instead — Dolly, and nothing
     else. Every other left-hand side here was checked the same way and occurs only in its event. */

     #R319 fixed two place names whose characters are ALREADY shared between the two orthographies,
     so the character layer converted them to themselves and a Taiwanese word shipped verbatim to a
     mainland reader — a defect no orthography check can see. 「社群」 (a community; the mainland
     word is 「社區」) was the next one, found in the airplanes.live source description while a
     parallel round was adding a second ADS-B feed beside it.
     ⚠ THE TABLE HAD NO WAY TO SAY WHAT IT WAS MISSING, so this round asked a published table
     instead of reading. OpenCC ships a SECOND Taiwan profile, twp→cn, which converts vocabulary as
     well as orthography — the very one #R251 refused to run in the pipeline because it double-
     converts this table's own output (檔案→文件→文档). Run OUTSIDE the pipeline it is not a
     converter but an INVENTORY: applied to the finished Simplified text, every place it disagrees
     is a word OpenCC says the two readerships write differently and this table does not mention.
     MEASURED over all 8,321 distinct Han runs in ui.zh.js + pages.zh-hant.js: 96 distinct
     disagreements at 615 sites. Most are that same double-conversion or plain context error and
     were read and rejected one at a time — 指標 is an INDICATOR here and not a pointer (28 sites),
     複製 is the Copy button and not cloning (#R322, 16), 時間序列 is a time series and not 串行
     (11), 堆疊 is stacking windows and not a call stack (12), 行程 is an itinerary and not a
     process (5), 簡報 is a briefing and not a slide deck (9). What survived is below: every entry
     was checked by listing ITS OWN sites and confirming the corpus carries no other sense.
     ⚠ THREE MORE ARE REAL AND ARE DELIBERATELY NOT HERE, because a bare word swap would be wrong:
     擷取 is 截取 in 「螢幕擷取」 but 抓取 in 「擷取標題」 (13 sites, two senses); 向量 is 矢量 for
     a vector tile but stays 向量 for a vector mean (4); 數位 has one bare site whose sense is not
     decidable from the string. Those need narrower left-hand sides — the 複製羊 shape — not a row.

     reader with every character already shared, so no orthography check could see it. So the twp→cn
     inventory of #R335 was run over THIS round's 256 new Simplified strings before they shipped: 9
     disagreements, of which 6 were real (below) and 3 were the same false positive (新增 for GVP's

     Read off the SHIPPED Simplified chunk after the round deployed: 「隐没带 / 大陆地壳」 and
     「放射成因：分裂径迹」. Both are the #R319/#R335 shape one more time — the characters are already
     shared, so the orthography layer converts them to themselves — and both slipped past the twp→cn
     inventory as well, because OpenCC's vocabulary profile does not carry these two geology terms.
     A mainland reader writes 俯衝帶 for a subduction zone and 裂變徑跡 for a fission track; 隱沒帶 and
     分裂徑跡 are the Taiwanese terms. ⚠ WHAT THIS SAYS ABOUT THE METHOD: the inventory is a FLOOR,
     not a ceiling — a batch of technical vocabulary has to be read term by term as well, and the
     place to read it is the generated Simplified text, not the Traditional source.
     ⚠ Every left-hand side was checked against its own sites: 隱沒帶 is the tectonic setting in four
     rows of ui.zh.js plus one sentence of pages.zh-hant.js («27 個活躍隱沒帶»); 隱沒板塊 is the slab in
     the sentence beside it; 分裂徑跡 occurs once, as the dating method. All one sense each.
     ⚠ AND THE ROWS STAY NARROW RATHER THAN BECOMING 隱沒→俯衝. All six occurrences of 隱沒 in the
     corpus are geological today, but the bare word ALSO means «to fade from view» in ordinary
     Chinese — so a blanket row would mistranslate the first non-geological sentence somebody writes.

   ⚠⚠⚠ (#R251) THIS WAS 440 HAND-TYPED PAIRS, AND IT COVERED 439 OF THE 1,529 HAN CHARACTERS
   ui.zh.js ACTUALLY USES. Everything outside it passed through unchanged, so the SIMPLIFIED file
   shipped Traditional characters inside Simplified sentences — 「烏克蘭前线」, 「貪腐指标」,
   「紐芬蘭自治领」, 「制藥生产基地」, 「樹木覆盖」, 「苔蘚与地衣」 — for as long as the table has
   existed. Nobody forgot anything: a hand-maintained character map has no way to say what it is
   MISSING, so each round added the characters that round happened to introduce and the gap grew in
   silence. That is [[intmap-recurring-lessons]] G in its purest form, and the same defect this
   round found in the translation instruments — a table of ours standing in for a published fact.

   ⚠ SO THE CHARACTERS ARE NOT OUR TABLE ANY MORE. OpenCC is the reference implementation of Han
   orthography conversion; opencc-js is its pure-JS port, and it is a BUILD-TIME devDependency —
   nothing new ships to the browser, because this script runs at build time and writes a file.
   `tw → cn` is the ORTHOGRAPHY, and it resolves every one-to-many case this file used to pin by
   hand: 著名 keeps 著, 着色 takes 着, 乾坤 keeps 乾, 乾燥 takes 干. That is precisely the knowledge
   the ⚠ notes above describe as the hard part, and it is published data.

   ⚠ NOT `twp`, WHICH CONVERTS THE VOCABULARY A SECOND TIME. The phrase-aware variant also rewrites
   Taiwanese TERMS into mainland ones — and the WORD table below has already done exactly that, in
   Traditional characters. Running both turned 檔案 into 文件 (the table, correctly) and then 文件
   into 文档 (OpenCC, reading our mainland word as a Taiwanese one). MEASURED: 「十年時光回溯檔案」
   came out as 「十年时光回溯文档」, and tests/r224 ④ caught it. One layer owns the vocabulary, the
   other owns the orthography.

   ⚠ THE WORD TABLE ABOVE STILL RUNS FIRST, AND STILL WINS. Those are this project's own choices
   about mainland vocabulary, reviewed one at a time over several rounds. OpenCC agrees with almost
   all of them; where the app wants a particular word regardless, the table is where that is said.

     added the first inline keys that are not English (JMA publishes its warnings in Japanese and
     the key IS what the agency said), and two of them came out mangled — 「レベル２（火口周辺規制）」
