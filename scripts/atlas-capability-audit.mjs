/* ============================================================================
 *  IntMap · THE CAPABILITY AUDIT  (#R318)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  `scripts/atlas-catalog.mjs` (#R278) asks ONE question: is every dispatch case mentioned in the
 *  planner's prompt? It is a good question and it caught six invisible features. It is also the only
 *  question anyone was asking, and the diary is full of the others:
 *
 *    · #R268 — a capability that runs, returns, and changes nothing
 *    · #R291 — a route computed and never drawn, reported as done
 *    · #R302 — a point-needing tool that quietly used the map centre
 *    · #R309 — wiring that existed and was cancelled in the same millisecond
 *
 *  Every one of those is a capability whose CLAIM and whose OBSERVATION disagreed. This file asks
 *  the twenty questions that would have caught them, against js/atlas-capabilities.js — which is
 *  now the one list of what IntMap can do — plus the source of the files that implement it.
 *
 *      node scripts/atlas-capability-audit.mjs            # the full report
 *      node scripts/atlas-capability-audit.mjs --check    # the gate (npm test, CI)
 *      node scripts/atlas-capability-audit.mjs --json     # the machine-readable audit (§2)
 *
 *  ⚠ A GREEN GATE NOBODY HAS SEEN GO RED IS NOT EVIDENCE. Every check below takes its inputs as
 *  DATA, and tests/r318-checks.test.mjs feeds each one a fixture with the defect deliberately
 *  present and asserts that it fails. A check that cannot be made to fail is deleted, not kept.
