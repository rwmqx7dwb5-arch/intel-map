 *  One list, in the order the wars happened. The record itself is in ./ww1.mjs and ./ww2.mjs; the
 *  rules both obey and the vocabulary they share are in ./lang.mjs; the coordinates every front line
 *  is quoted through are in ./places.mjs. scripts/build-wars.mjs is what turns all four into
 *  data/wars.json, and it is the only thing that is allowed to decide the file is correct.
