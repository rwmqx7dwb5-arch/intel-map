 *  IntMap · data/hist-cities.json — the name a city carried in the year on the clock   (#R427)
 *  ⚠⚠⚠ …AND WHICH CITY THAT IS — the guard radius                                      (#R521)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  「都市名ラベルも同じ要領で（Chronos に）対応するように。」 The country labels have travelled
 *  in time since #R94k; scripts/histcities/*.mjs is the same record for SETTLEMENTS, and this
 *  turns it into the one file the app fetches.
 *
 *  ══ ⚠⚠⚠ WHAT #R521 CHANGED, AND WHY «Kochi» WAS NOT ONE BAD ROW ════════════════════════════
 *  A reader travelling to 1950 saw 高知市 relabelled コーチン. The row is right — Kochi in
 *  Kerala WAS Cochin until 1996 — and the row was not the defect. The defect was that a SPELLING
 *  was being used as an IDENTITY: js/hist-cities.js rewrote `ofm-city`'s `text-field` wherever
 *  the tile's own name matched a key, with nothing in the expression that could tell one Kochi
 *  from another. Every city on Earth sharing a spelling with a row was in scope, and the record
 *  holds 1 034 spellings.
 *
 *  So identity is now NAME **AND** PLACE. Each row carries a guard radius `g`; the runtime asks
 *  MapLibre's `distance` expression how far the candidate feature is from the row's coordinate
 *  and only renames it inside that radius. Kochi, Japan is 6 900 km from Kochi, Kerala.
 *
 *  ══ AND THE GATE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO CATCH IT HAD THE ANSWER DELETED FROM ITS EVIDENCE ═════
 *  #R427's rule was «no other settlement of 20 000+ may carry this spelling», resolved against
 *  data/gazetteer-world.json.gz. That file is built for js/newsgeo.js, which needs ONE point per
 *  spelling, so scripts/build-gazetteer.mjs keeps `the more populous homonym` and drops the rest
 *  — plus every Latin form under four characters, every ordinary word, and everything a curated
 *  table owns. ⚠⚠⚠ THE UNIQUENESS THE GATE WAS ASKED TO PROVE HAD BEEN IMPOSED ON ITS ORACLE.
 *  Kirov (Kaluga oblast, 39 319, `place=town`) and Linden (New Jersey, 42 021, `place=town`) are
 *  both absent from it for exactly that reason, and both are namesakes of rows in this record.
 *  Kochi, Japan was invisible twice over: its GeoNames name is «Kōchi» with a macron, and the
 *  gazetteer's alternate names are filtered to the eighteen languages the news locator can
 *  tokenise, which do not include English.
 *
 *  The evidence is now data/histcities-homonyms.json.gz (scripts/build-histcities-homonyms.mjs):
 *  GeoNames cities500, unfiltered, restricted to the spellings this record actually joins on.
 *
 *  ══ WHAT IS PROVEN HERE, ROW BY ROW ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *   ① THE COORDINATE IS THE CITY. Some settlement carrying one of the row's spellings, in the
 *      row's own country, must sit within ANCHOR_TOL_KM of the row's point. ⚠ This used to be a
 *      40 km formality; it is now load-bearing, because the guard is centred on that point and a
 *      coordinate 26 km out means the rename never happens. It found four (Sorokyne, KwaDukuza,
 *      Kunming, Kariega). A row GeoNames genuinely does not carry says so in `unlisted`.
 *   ② THE GUARD SEPARATES. `g` = half the distance to the nearest OTHER settlement answering to
 *      one of the row's spellings under its OWN name — never more than GUARD_MAX_KM. Derived,
 *      not typed: no row can be given a radius that reaches its namesake. Below GUARD_FLOOR_KM
 *      the two cannot be told apart at all and the build stops.
 *   ③ A NAMESAKE INSIDE THE GUARD IS DECLARED, AND THE DECLARATION IS RE-TESTED. Twin towns
 *      (Valga/Valka, 1.2 km) are closer than any radius. Those need `waive`, which names the
 *      other place and asserts the spelling reaches it ONLY through GeoNames' alternate list —
 *      an assertion this build re-checks every run. If GeoNames promotes it to that town's own
 *      name, the waiver stops being true and the build fails. ⚠ That is the whole difference
 *      from #R427's «!» suffix, which was an unconditional bypass of every finding for a key.
 *   ④ A KEY MAY NOT REPEAT, anywhere, including inside its own row — every key is a branch label
 *      in one MapLibre `match`, and a repeated label is a REJECTED STYLE, not a wrong answer.
 *   ⑤ ERAS are ordered, disjoint, complete in nine languages, and reachable by the clock.
 *
 *  ⚠ AND THE COMMITTED FILE IS RE-DERIVED, byte for byte, by `--check` (npm run check:histcities,
 *  inside `npm test`) — so data/hist-cities.json cannot drift away from the record.
 *
 *      node scripts/build-hist-cities.mjs            # write data/hist-cities.json
 *      node scripts/build-hist-cities.mjs --check    # re-derive and compare; exit 1 on any drift
 *      node scripts/build-hist-cities.mjs --report   # the coverage table, per language
 *      node scripts/build-hist-cities.mjs --audit    # every row × every namesake, as a table
