/* ============================================================================
 *  IntMap · `npm test` IS TWO INDEPENDENT HALVES, SO IT RUNS THEM AT THE SAME TIME  (#R205)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  「毎回毎回、テストに時間がかかりすぎ。いい加減にしろ。すべてが長すぎる。明らかにテストが過剰。
 *    ずっと言っているがテスト時間が壊滅的に長いまま変わっていない。大幅に過剰。簡易でいい。」
 *
 *  #R203 split the SUITE (85 min → an 8 min gate) and #R204 turned the gate's membership into a price
 *  (484 s → 173 s). Both worked on the same half of `npm test` — the browser half — while the other
 *  half sat in front of it in a `&&` chain:
 *
 *      node static-checks && node engine-coupling --gate && node test-budget && npm run test:checks
 *          && node run-tests            ← the browser suite does not start until all of that is done
 *
 *  Those two halves share nothing. The first is source-level: it parses the repository with acorn and
 *  runs ~60 `node --test` files that read files off disk. The second builds the site, serves it on
 *  4173 and drives Chromium. Neither reads the other's output, and the browser half spends most of
 *  its wall clock waiting for a browser rather than using the CPU — so running them in sequence pays
 *  for the source half twice: once in CPU and once in wall clock.
 *
 *  Running them together makes `npm test` cost max(a, b) instead of a + b.
 *
 *  ⚠ BOTH STILL RUN, AND EITHER STILL FAILS THE COMMAND. There is no "fail fast" here on purpose: a
 *  static-check failure that killed the browser half would hide a browser regression behind a missing
 *  semicolon, and the whole point of this file is that you learn everything from one run.
 *  ⚠ OUTPUT IS PREFIXED AND BUFFERED PER LINE. Two children writing to one terminal interleave
 *  mid-line otherwise, and a half-written assertion message is worse than a slower run.
