 *  IntMap · DO THE DOCUMENTS STILL AGREE WITH THE REPOSITORY, AND WITH EACH OTHER?
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Some facts are written down in more than one place: how many Edge Functions there are,
 *  what is actually served, which languages exist, how the production deploy works. Every
 *  one of those is a fact that can rot in ONE document while the others stay right, and
 *  nothing notices — the reader who happens to open the stale one is simply misled.
 *
 *  This checks the facts that are BOTH written down and MEASURABLE. It deliberately does
 *  not try to check prose.
 *
 *  ⚠ THE SCAN COVERS THE CURRENT-STATE DOCUMENTS ONLY. `DEV-NOTES.md` and
 *    `DEV-NOTES-ARCHIVE.md` are the history, and history legitimately quotes text that was
 *    true once and is wrong now. Scanning them would make every recorded mistake a failure.
 *
 *  ⚠ AND IT MUST NOT CATCH ITSELF. Several rules below are "no document says X". The
 *    document that DESCRIBES those rules (Architecture.md §15.5) therefore must not spell X
 *    out literally, and the needles here are assembled from parts so that this file is not
 *    a copy of the thing it forbids. This exact self-hit has happened repeatedly in this
 *    repository; see [[intmap-recurring-lessons]].

   every `.md` under `.claude/` — the standing rules, the round procedure, the subagent
   definitions — says
   the same measurable things the prose documents say, and they had been outside every sweep in
   this file. Measured: `.claude/skills/intmap-round/SKILL.md` §6 told the reader to deploy
   「9 本」 and named nine of them, three rounds after #R399 audited that exact number across
   the documents and rebuilt the rule below for it. The audit could not have caught it: the
   file was not in the set being read.
   ⚠ These are not a lesser class of document. They are the ones a session reads BEFORE it does
     anything, so a stale fact here is acted on rather than merely misread — the nine-name list
     is a deploy instruction, and following it silently skips three functions.
   ⚠ ANOTHER CHECKOUT IS NOT THIS CHECKOUT'S DOCUMENTS. The harness puts its worktrees under
     `.claude/worktrees/`, each a complete copy of the repository (measured #R282: 2 of them,
     11,615 files). Walking into those would scan every document twice over at whatever commit

 *    UNDER IT. Three holes, every one of them silent — the report stayed green and said so:
 *
 *      · THE DOCUMENT LIST WAS HAND-MAINTAINED. It named `AGENTS.md` and `Architecture.md`.
 *        `docs/FILES.md` was never added, so its ledger sat at "全11本" and "9本" while the
 *        tree held twelve, and `SECURITY.md` ("eight") and `docs/SECURITY-ARCHITECTURE.md`
 *        ("ELEVEN") were never looked at at all.
 *      · THE NEEDLE REQUIRED A LITERAL ASTERISK (`\*\*?` = one `*`, then an optional second).
 *        `AGENTS.md` writes `**Edge Functions は 12 本**` — the asterisks are BEFORE the noun —
 *        so the count matched nothing and `claimed` came back null on every run. AGENTS.md was
 *        right for four rounds by luck: the per-name roster check below is what held it, and a
 *        count check that never fires is indistinguishable from one that passes.
 *      · IT USED `.match()`, WHICH RETURNS THE FIRST HIT ONLY. `Architecture.md`'s §6.2 heading
 *        answered for the whole file, so its SECOND claim — "Edge Functions を10本デプロイする"
 *        in §10.1 — was invisible, with a deploy list directly beneath it that already ran twelve.
 *
 *    So: sweep EVERY current-state document, EVERY occurrence, digits AND number-words. The
 *    only hand-written name left is the 正本 (`Architecture.md`), and it is named to demand MORE,
 *    not less — it must state the number, so rewording it into a shape the needle cannot read
 *    fails instead of going quiet. Everywhere else the contract is "if you state it, it must be
 *    right", which is what lets a document link to §6.2 instead of counting.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  ⚠ AND IT MUST NOT CATCH ITSELF — the header's warning applies here. The needles are built
 *    from parts and the examples above are quoted with their WRONG numbers, so this comment is

   *  (#R403) #R399 widened the COUNT check to every document and every occurrence, and the
   *  count in `.claude/skills/intmap-round/SKILL.md` §6 still went unread for three rounds —
   *  「Edge Function を変えたなら本番へ出す（9 本: …）」 puts the number at the end of the
   *  clause, and 2a below only reads a number bound directly to the noun. Widening the sweep
   *  to that file (above) did not catch it either: measured, the report stayed green with the
   *  wrong nine-name list sitting in it. Two silent misses of one fact, in a row.
   *
   *  So this reads the LIST rather than the number. A roster is not a matter of phrasing: it
   *  is a run of real function names, and a document that writes one is claiming those are the
   *  functions. What it must not do is read a legitimately PARTIAL list as a roster — and the

   *

   *                         — complete, about the unauthenticated relays, not about the roster
   *    · Architecture.md   `for f in refresh-news monitor-run sv-cov …` — the deploy loop, split
   *                         in two, so neither half is the whole set
   *    · docs/SECURITY-ARCHITECTURE.md  "All twelve are declared there now (`aviation-feed` #R341,
   *                         `routing-relay` #R347, …)" — names the four that were added, not all
   *
   *  What the two real claims have and those three do not is the NOUN: the words «Edge Function»
   *  introduce the list. Measured over the whole corpus at a 40 / 60 / 90 character lead window,
   *  that separates 2 from 3 identically at all three — a discriminator, not a tuned threshold.
   *  A list that says of itself that it is partial (`など` / `ほか` / `その他` / `etc.`) is left
   *  alone, the same escape rule 2b gives the `_shared` inventories.
   *
   *  ⚠ AND IT MUST NOT CATCH ITSELF — no run of three function names appears in this comment,
   *    and docs/TESTING.md describes the rule without spelling the roster out. tests/r403-checks

/* ═══ 22. WHEN THE DEEP TIER RUNS — derived from ci.yml's own gate ═════════════════════════
   (#R407) MEASURED: scripts/tiers.mjs, scripts/run-tests.mjs, scripts/test-budget.mjs, ci.yml
   itself, .github/actions/browser-tier/action.yml and FIVE files under tests/ — thirteen claims
   across ten files — all said the deep tier runs after each merge. #R207 took it off `push` TWO
   HUNDRED ROUNDS EARLIER; the post-merge CI run for 7d2e21e (2026-08-24, run 32708285103) skipped
   both deep jobs. The two places that were right — package.json's `//test:deep` and
   docs/TESTING.md — were right for no enforced reason.

   ⚠ AND THE GATE ITSELF WAS GUARDED THE WHOLE TIME. tests/r207-checks ⑫ has asserted that `if:`
   since the round that wrote it: schedule and dispatch present, `push` absent. It passed on every
   one of those 200 rounds. What nobody held to it was the PROSE — so the half a machine reads was
   correct and the half a person reads was not, and only the person acts on it.

   It is not a cosmetic rot. A round that believes the merge will catch a deep regression does not
   run `npm run test:deep` before opening its PR and does not treat a deep red as its own problem;
   that belief is what #R400 measured as six consecutive red nights and what let #R372 追記's
   regression be found by production first.

   So the trigger set is READ OUT OF THE WORKFLOW, and the prose is measured against it in both
   directions:
     · ARM A (negative, swept over the tree). No file may name the nightly and, joined straight to
       it, a trigger the job does not have. The file list is DERIVED — `git grep` for the nightly
       across tracked files — because a hand-kept list of documents to scan is itself the defect
       (#R399). Only the two history files are dropped, for the reason at the top of this file.
     · ARM B (positive, the 正本 only). docs/TESTING.md must state, for EVERY event the workflow
       triggers on, whether this tier runs on it. It is named here so that a document which stops
       stating the fact FAILS instead of quietly falling out of the scan — hand-write the 正本, and
       put it on the side that goes red when the sentence is absent (#R399).

   ⚠ THE NEEDLES ARE ASSEMBLED FROM PARTS so this file is not a copy of the sentence it forbids —
   the precaution the header of this file describes, and the reason arm A does not catch itself.
   ⚠ ARM A IS A NEEDLE AND NEEDLES ARE INCOMPLETE. Prose that puts a whole clause between the
   nightly and the claim slips past it; arm B is the half that cannot be phrased around, because it
   reads the gate and demands an answer. tests/r407-checks proves both halves go red.

   Cost, measured: 48 candidate files / 747 kB, of which the scan is 38 ms — the ~1.2 s this rule
   adds is almost entirely the `git grep` process spawn on Windows. */
