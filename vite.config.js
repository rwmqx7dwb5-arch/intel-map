/* ============================================================================
 *  IntMap · Vite build  (#R175)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  「IntMapのモダンな実装によるVite化と高速化を、品質を一切落とさず…全面的に進めてください」
 *
 *  The repo root IS the site — index.html at the top, css/ and js/ beside it, and a pile of static
 *  assets (the Köppen rasters, the flag webfont, the service worker, data/, admin.html, the Google
 *  verification file) that GitHub Pages has always published verbatim. That shape is kept: `root` is
 *  the repo root and the build output is a COMPLETE deployable tree in dist/, so "what Pages serves"
 *  is still one directory and nothing has to be assembled by hand.
 *
 *  ── base: './' ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  The site lives at https://rwmqx7dwb5-arch.github.io/IntMap/ — a project page, not a domain root.
 *  Relative URLs make the build independent of that prefix, so the same dist/ works from the Pages
 *  sub-path, from `vite preview`, and from scripts/serve.mjs during tests.
 *
 *  ── WHY THE STATIC ASSETS ARE AN EXPLICIT LIST ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  Vite's `publicDir` copies one directory verbatim; here the "public directory" is the repo root
 *  itself, which also contains node_modules/, .git/, tests/, supabase/ and the sources. Pointing
 *  publicDir at the root is not an option, and quietly copying "everything that isn't source" would
 *  publish the operational tooling. So the shipping assets are NAMED below, and
 *  tests/r175-checks.test.mjs fails if a root asset that index.html/sw.js reference is missing from
 *  the list — a new asset cannot be silently left out of the deploy, which is the one failure mode
 *  this arrangement could otherwise have.

     `data` is copied whole (above), and it contained BOTH representations of one dataset:
       data/ecoregions_2017.js       9,761,502 B   window.__ECOREGIONS_2017 = {…}
       data/ecoregions_2017.geojson  9,761,476 B   the same object, as JSON
     MEASURED: strip the 25-byte assignment prefix and the trailing semicolon from the .js and the
     remainder is SHA-256-identical to the .geojson. A session loads exactly one of them, so the
     second was 9.76 MB of deploy — 8 % of the whole tree — that no visitor could ever use.

     The .js exists because of #R13b, and that round's reason is worth reading before undoing this:
     the site was then opened as `file:///…/index.html`, where Chrome blocks fetch() of a local file,
     so the data had to arrive through a <script> tag. That is no longer a situation this app can be
     in — since #R175 index.html loads `<script type="module" crossorigin>`, which `file://` refuses
     outright, and AGENTS.md §2 records `file://` as unsupported. The scenario the second copy was
     for cannot occur, and it was costing every visitor's CDN and every deploy.

     ⚠ NOTHING IS DELETED. The .js stays in the repository (it is the input the .geojson-only deploy
     could be rebuilt from, and #R13b's technique still works if a `file://` build is ever wanted);
     it simply stops being copied into dist/. js/layer-packs.js `window.__loadEcoregions` keeps both
     paths and only their ORDER changed — fetch first, <script> second — so no branch was removed.
     JSON.parse is also the faster of the two: the <script> form makes V8 parse 9.76 MB as JavaScript
     source, on the main thread, where JSON.parse has a dedicated fast path. */

     that a row's guard radius reaches its own city and no other. Nothing in js/ or src/ fetches

     is the only one they can reach.
